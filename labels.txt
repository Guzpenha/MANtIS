I've a MacBook Pro and Mavericks. My browsers are blocked by ramsonware. It asks 100 $/Euro and says that your computer is blocked by the Italian cops and constantly redirects you to a fake page.I've tried to remove it resetting Safari and Chrome, but the virus is still alive.What should I do to remove this thing?

Here is a link for removing ransomware on a Mac.it's pretty easy:<a href="http://www.thesafemac.com/fbi-ransomware-virus-rampant/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesafemac.com/fbi-ransomware-virus-rampant/</a>From the post:  There have been many reports among Mac users recently of being “infected” with an FBI ransomware “virus,” telling them that their computer has been seized and that they have to pay money to get it unlocked. Fortunately, from the reports I’ve been getting, there is no indication that this is actually Mac malware of any kind. It’s simply an obnoxious browser pop-up, displayed via JavaScript, in an attempt to fool people into paying.    I have yet to see this behavior first-hand, but it’s undoubtedly being caused by JavaScript that has been injected into legit sites, either through malicious ads or by hacking the site. Keep in mind that the old wisdom that you’re fine if you avoid “bad” sites is no longer particularly good. Most malware these days is distributed through legit sites, so any site could potentially fall victim.    force quit Safari    The question, then, is what to do if you see this pop-up. If you cannot close the window or the browser, then you will need to force the browser to quit. Press command-option-esc to display the force quit window. In that window, make sure your web browser is selected, then click the Force Quit button. Once the browser quits, you can close the force quit window.    Depending on your browser and/or system settings, your browser may try to reload the pages that were open the last time it quit. This could cause the problem to recur immediately, as soon as you open your browser again. In Safari, you can avoid this by holding down the shift key while opening the app.    Once you have your browser open again, you should be fine. You could clear your cookies and browser cache if you like, but that really won’t be particularly useful. Contrary to popular belief, this will not cure such problems or prevent them from occurring.

Ok but how i remove the .js file from my computer? I dont' want to believe that there is no way to find the file that cause the pop-up to show up and delete it from the system...

Recently a the Dutch government advised to put a tape on your webcam to prevent hackers from taking pictures and video using your device (<a href="http://nos.nl/artikel/597896-justitie-plak-je-webcam-af.html">news article in Dutch</a>).The build in iSight camera in Apple laptops have a green light next to the camera, this light turns green when you use the camera.Is it possible to use the camera without the activation of the green light? Personally I think the green light turns on when the sensor requires power and this is hardwired in the hardware. Am I wrong?I have found similar questions on stackexchange, but I found non that answer this specific question.

<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/141508/Is+the+iSight+indicator+LED+hardwired+or+can+it+be+circumvented" rel="noreferrer">"iSeeYou: Disabling the MacBook Webcam Indicator LED"</a> is a paper by Matthew Brocker and Stephen Checkoway from the Johns Hopkins University. In this paper they explain on how to disable the LED when using the camera. In short: normally you use the CPU to access the camera and activate the LED, but you can also use the processing unit in on the camera board itself and this will not activate the green LED. The authors also provide software to protect you against these problems.iFixit had the same question and their <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/141508/Is+the+iSight+indicator+LED+hardwired+or+can+it+be+circumvented" rel="noreferrer">answer</a> was also based on the same paper:  according to the researchers, the vulnerability they discovered affects “Apple internal iSight webcams found in earlier-generation Apple products, including the iMac G5 and early Intel-based iMacs, MacBooks, and MacBook Pros until roughly 2008.” While the attack outlined in the paper is limited to these devices, researchers like Charlie Miller suggest that the attack could be applicable to newer systems as well. “There’s no reason you can’t do it -- it’s just a lot of work and resources but it depends on how well [Apple] secured the hardware,” Miller says.In short: Yes, the iSight can be used without green light as it is not hardwired.

I know Activity Monitor exists to view disk i/o and other performance metrics. However, does Activity Monitor have the ability to log any of these metrics?If not, how can I log these metrics into a database or csv file and how often should these be logged? Every second?I'm looking to run reports to see at what times of the day the server has a lot of disk i/o for capacity management. Also want the ability to log used and free space every 15 minutes.

agent
You can use traditional unix tools to start monitoring now.iostat 60 | tee /tmp/iostat_60.logThe free space statistics can be generated with the df command, but you might just set your warning levels on server app and rely on alerts to notify you when space fills. I can't imagine needing to track storage space more than once a day to graph the growth or manage things, but your needs might be quite different.I'd say 15 minute (900 seconds for iostat) snaps of io activity would be sufficient and hourly or daily disk space logs would be overkill for most servers. You would probably decrease the monitoring interval during an investigation / performance tuning period, but day in and day out thesestats usually just chew up CPU and disk space and don't really help you manage the server.Once you decide upon how often you want to capture the data, you can get more fancy with a wrapper to start and stop the script / cut and process the log files daily, etc...I would say you're going to want to instead look at the tools you want for actually analyzing and acting on the data. For one server, you could probably get away with one free instance of <a href="http://www.splunk.com" rel="nofollow">splunk</a> running and just log the data to syslog. From there you can graph / extract to spreadsheet / act on the data in a very flexible manner. Also, you might look at <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org" rel="nofollow">elasticsearch</a>, <a href="http://logstash.net" rel="nofollow">logstash</a> and <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/" rel="nofollow">kibana</a>.There is an excellent write up at <a href="http://krypted.com/windows-server/stashbox-turning-a-mac-mini-into-a-logstash-server/" rel="nofollow">http://krypted.com/windows-server/stashbox-turning-a-mac-mini-into-a-logstash-server/</a> by Charles Edge explaining the how and why you would use those tools to tame the logs and graph things. If you had that, sending the statistics to the system log might be a very easy way to solve your problem of monitoring IO on your server.

user
I agree that 15 minute snaps of disk usage is overkill in my situation. I can probably get away with daily. When I run the df command, it populates all the partitions. Is it possible to just capture the /dev/sda1? I also would like the output to be in a csv file as NAME_OF_DISK,Used,Available,Use% and not include anything else.

agent
You can do just about anything with `grep, awk, and sed` and python has really nice csv input and output. It depends if you like to script. `df | grep disk0s2 | awk '{ print $2 "," $3 "," $4}'`

user
Awesome! Now how can I just capture the total disk i/o and not per running application/process in the same csv format?

I bought a new latest Mac book pro Retina. I see in my mac book, there are two ports: one for thunderbolt and one for HDMI (or HDMI, I don't know).I want to output to monitor with VGA display, so I need a converter. As I know, there are two type of converters as I research: HDMI to VGA and Mini DisplayPort to VGA. So I have many questions because I don't sure about those port:Does my mac have Mini DisplayPort ? I see in this link: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3382" rel="nofollow">Apple Support</a> says that Mini DisplayPort and thunderbolt is comparable, right? So I can use Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter for thunderbolt port ?Which adapter should I use for output to monitor. HDMI to VGA or Mini DisplayPort to VGA. If I can use both, which is better ? Macbook pro ships with HDMI or mini HDMI. I guess HDMI but I'm not sure.I'm sorry for those questions because my lack of hardware knowledge. Thanks :) 

agent
You can connect the Thunderbolt port to a VGA adapter for your VGA monitor.I'm pretty sure it does not matter. I'm not sure if a simple HDMI-to-VGA adapter even exists.The Macbook Retina that I have has 2 thunderbolt ports and one normal-size HDMI port.This MacRumors topic contains some useful info as well:<a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1426993" rel="nofollow">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1426993</a>

thanks for your link. that's help me. about (2), i'm pretty sure that HDMI-to-VGA exist, you can google it. after researching, I understand that thunderbolt can be used to transfer data/audio/video ... and connect to screen too. So, now, I don't know, which is better to use. Do you know ? Thanks :)

agent
Your Macbook Pro Retina has 2 thunderbolt ports, so you can use 1 for your monitor and the other for possible data transfer using a thunderbolt connector cable.About the adapter you're right: they are simple and cheap. :)Speaking of cheap, and please excuse me if I've misread the situation, you are getting a Macbook Retina and still use a VGA monitor? Maybe you should consider getting a newer monitor with DVI to take advantage of your macbook's digital signal instead of converting it to analog VGA. Good luck!

user
@Sephia thanks for helping me. now i understand all now. about VGA Monitor, just because I bought it last 2 years and it shipped with my PC. Before that, I have never though about vga/dvi/thunderbolt ... just now. i need to transfer to lcd for easier to work. so maybe as you said, if image quanlity is slow. maybe i will change to more suitable monitor :D

I'm looking for an audio meter tool that will attach to any input or output on my Mac and show me the audio levels on that channel. I need it to show me independent levels for stereo sources so I can tell if a source is playing only audio on one channel or another.Does anything like this exist?

Ignore the small record button - Piezo's interface is basically two meters and you don't need to pay unless you want to record more than ten minutes at a time. It should work indefinitely as a monitor for you.

@Ramy Al Zuhouri, All I can say is, I downloaded the linked PDF document, opened it in Preview and tested the three methods I've presented in the answer and in all cases the note icon was deleted along with its yellow color. Nothing was left behind from the deletion of the notes. The only yellow remaining in the document is in the signature field however this is not a _note_ nor did I see a way to change it. I've uploaded a modified copy of the [linked document here](http://docdro.id/pKME7Qi).

I've found out what was the problem: if I delete a note, the yellow square doesn't disappear. But if I save, close and reopen the document I don't see it anymore. It's probably a bug.

I have a MacBook Pro Retina, Mid 2015 running macOS Sierra 10.12.2.I want to completely stop my power button turning off, sleeping or restarting my device; I have already tried other solutions such as running this command:defaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool nobut all that does is change the behaviour to opening a window with a default action of shut down!I just want to stop other people, or myself, from purposefully/accidentally using it to turn off my computer. It's a button I've never used, apart from when I first bought my MacBook sometime two years ago.I still need the button to be able to turn on the device, obviously.

agent
I make the app <a href="https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PowerKey</a>, which allows you to remap a tap of the power key to input Forward Delete or another command. Might be useful for some who find this answer. It does not modify the hold-to-shutdown behavior, however, and that is not the goal of the app.However, there was an <a href="https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/issues/14" rel="nofollow noreferrer">issue with OS X Mavericks</a> that had people searching for a way to modify the power key tap and hold behavior. That lead binchewer to release several tools and patches in that vein such as power_fixer. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160202223452/http://binchewer.org/blog/index.php?id=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://web.archive.org/web/20160202223452/http://binchewer.org/blog/index.php?id=1</a><a href="https://github.com/binchewer/power_fixer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/binchewer/power_fixer</a><a href="https://github.com/binchewer/power_fixer/pull/8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/binchewer/power_fixer/pull/8</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1u5v5e/mavericks_power_button_fix/ceisg91/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1u5v5e/mavericks_power_button_fix/ceisg91/</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OSXTweaks/comments/1yguq4/request_fix_the_power_button_back_to_how_it_was/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/OSXTweaks/comments/1yguq4/request_fix_the_power_button_back_to_how_it_was/</a>  On the reddit link, binchewer posted a command that, at least at the time, disabled the power key completely.I'm not sure if it will work today, especially with System Integrity Protection enabled.WARNING: likely many side effects. Your computer will not sleep automatically when you close the lid. No way to force a restart if your computer hangs. Etc.  Investigating further. Expect to finish in a week. Small hint for those, who want to simply turn the button off:kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleACPIPlatform.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleACPIButtons.kext/Will need to be run with sudo. Please use and experiment at your own risk.

user
That final command, which is taken from the reddit post, doesn't work. Instead, the button now forces a hard shut down after it has been held a while.

agent
@theonlygusti it did work in OS X 10.9.1, you may want to do some investigation around disabling `AppleACPIButtons.kext` in Sierra if the procedure has changed. You'll likely also need to disable SIP.

user
SIP is already disabled, DanHolli (another answerer) told me "There is no way of disabling the press and hold force shutdown as it is handled by the hardware and cannot be affected by the software... unless possibly flash an edited BIOS that disables it"Did it actually work in 10.9.1? Or did it just prevent the annoying Mavericks thing? (Instant shut down)

agent
@theonlygusti IIRC it completely disabled both tapping and holding of the power key. I quickly disabled it, though, as it was far too annoying to not have the MacBook sleep when I shut the lid.

Hmm, and you are on 10.9.1?

A friend just recently bought a MacBookPro10,1 (MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) off of craigslist, it all checked out and worked fine until we erased the hard drive and reinstalled Mavericks (downloaded Mavericks from AppStore on my computer and used <a href="http://diskmakerx.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DiskMaker X v3.0.4</a> to create a bootable usb).It would go through first stage of install (copying files), but after reboot it would hang on the Apple logo plus spinning gear thing. We figured out it would only boot in Safe Mode.After a few hours of reinstalling and resetting stuff like NVRAM/PRAM and trying to get into AHT(unsuccessfully) and a bunch of other things, it finally would boot normally(without Safe Mode or any other keys pressed on boot).It was very exciting, except on further use, some of the system images would come up odd colors and distorted/noisy. And it even freezes sometimes.I guess it might be a graphics issue(?), but what would cause only some images to be like this? Is it still recoverable? Has anyone else had similar issues?I really appreciate any help in advance! Thanks!

agent
It sounds like your USB did not contain the clean bootable version.I would suggest you start over and follow the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5856" rel="nofollow">procedure from Apple</a>.You can get a copy of 10.9.5 from here or from Apple Store.<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1761" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1761</a>Make sure the USB is single partition and minimal 8 Gig. (no other partitions on that disk)

user
Thanks, when we did that, the install did go better! And we were finally able to get into the Apple Hardware Tests. But, it gave us a code we [figured out](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/finding-hardware-faults-exploring-aht-apple-diagnostics--mac-60456) was related to an electrical sensor for DC. We did a SMC reset, and then did an AHT extended test. And then it gave a code related to power bus temperature.The person my friend bought it from was nice enough to let my friend return it if there were any hardware issues, so I think they are just going to return it.Which I realize is a completely different problem (probably) from what I originally described, but none the less still an issue. I guess your answer was the solution to the original problem, so I'll accept it, even though there are still existing problems.Like also when we plugged in the USB, it crashed the computer (full gray screen with black text, nothing can be done except force shutdown). But if the USB is in before it boot, no crash.Anyway, thanks for the help. I didn't know Apple made a utility to create bootable USBs. I'll be using that instead of DiskMaker X from now on!

agent
Well, we got it to install and boot :) the other problems are other problems, but since now you can access it use the Console log and report (in a new post) the problems., or just return it. From your initial report they do not look like major and maybe fixable.

Anything involving accessing low level features like CPU instructions is going to require kernel access. This is definitely a case of you should know what you're doing first, as messing with memory on the kernel level seems like it would have any number of terrible ways it could go wrong.Assuming you do, you can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/KernelExtensions/KernelExtensions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016462-CH4-SW1" rel="nofollow">install unsigned kexts</a> by disabling the System Integrity Protection.To do so, boot into recovery mode (hold ⌘R when rebooting), open Terminal (in the Utilities menu), and run csrutil disable. Then reboot as per usual and install the kext.

user
I don't have access to recovery mode that is why I said "I can't install non signed kexts on my Mac". Can't I access kernel without depending on a kernel extension?

Not to the best of my knowledge. Kernel extensions are how you modify the kernel on a Mac. What's keeping you from accessing recovery mode?

When I log onto my Mac with FileVault enabled, I am prompted for the user/pass prior to the OS loading, as my boot drive is encrypted.The problem I have is that, counter-intuitively, it always shows my name as the login user! I just want blank fields that ask for the username and password respectively, not a prompt for my password.Does anyone know how to fix this?Edit: This is a screenshot of how Users &amp; Groups is configured:

agent
That is just how FileVault2 (introduced with 10.7) works.You have a pre-defined set of "Enabled Users" that are allowed to decrypt the boot drive, and those are the users (just your account in this case) that get listed in the first boot screen. Since you have only one account the system deduced automatically that only your account would be the one to unlock the drive. Since the users are predefined, Apple felt it best to just display the accounts in a clickable list.The reason for this is if you had multiple accounts on the computer, but only wanted a select few to be able to unlock the drive you could enable those specific users and make it so the others required additional authorization from an enabled user.OS X also has a handy little helper in that OS X will pass the login info that you gave it during the boot drive unlock into the login window and bypass that screen so you don't have to type in your user/pass twice. <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790">http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790</a><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18637">http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18637</a>

user
Thanks for clarifying that, Ryan. None of that precludes having the option of a blank username field though. Oh well, C'est Apple.

agent
Well, it does if you think about it from the way Apple has historically handled usability by giving an obvious in your face method. Giving a user a blank user name could give users the impression that any user/pass would work at that screen when in fact only a select few could work. Speaking for myself, I would certainly get that impression if I setup FV and rebooted the computer, and I would for sure get frustrated trying to figure out why I couldn't login with one of my other accounts if I didn't know about the enabled users setting.

user
and that would fail. I would rather have a stranger/snoop/thief not pick up my computer and know the name of the owner without even trying. It truly doesn't preclude having the option because that is entirely consistent with the  options one has at login - to show an icon and name of potential users or just two blank fields. Following that logic, it *should* be consistent with the user's choice in System Prefs, as that is the only option you have to specify your *preference*. This costs effectively nothing from a programming perspective at all.

What is a combo update and how is it different from a normal update?

agent
When Apple releases a minor system version (e.g. 10.8.1 -> 10.8.2), they generally release the update in two forms:A delta update containing all of the files that changed in the latest update, which therefore can only upgrade from the immediately previous version.For example, in order to install the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1580">10.8.2 delta update</a>, your system must already be updated to 10.8.1.A combo update containing all of the changes since the original release of that major version, and therefore can be used on anything from the same major version.For example, the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1581">10.8.2 combo update</a> can update from either 10.8.0 or 10.8.1; it can even be reinstalled on a system that's already running 10.8.2.Similarly, the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1582">10.7.5 combo update</a> can be run on anything from 10.7.0 to 10.7.5.(Note that for the first update to a major version, e.g. 10.8.1 or 10.7.1, there's no real distinction between delta and combo, so Apple only publishes a single update form.)If you have a Mac that's running the next-to-latest version and want to update it, the delta is technically all you need. But some people (myself included) tend to prefer the combo, for a couple of reasons:I update a lot of computers, so to save time I carry the latest updates on my tools HD. It's simplest to just carry the combo update and not worry about the deltas as well, since you can use the combo anyplace the delta would be appropriate.If anything has gone wrong with any of the previous updates, running the combo will generally clean up the problem, while a delta might leave it broken. In fact, sometimes re-running the combo on an already-updated computer will fix problems like this, so it's a useful trick to have in your troubleshooting repertoire. (Mind you, the types of problems this solves are rare; but they tend to be ones that otherwise would've involved hours of troubleshooting and hair-tearing, so it's often worth a try.)

user
Thanks a million. I am new to Mac and I was updating from 10.6.0 to 10.6.8. I was doing it sequentially and have downloaded 10.6.4 until now. Now downloading 10.6.8 Combo :)

In that situation I'd definitely go with the combo. BTW, if you use Software Update (under the Apple menu), it'll automatically pick the appropriate one.

I tried the automatic software update but it gives me some error after downloading the whole update.

I traveled to another country and forgot to change the time of my Nikon camera to local time.So after returning I used exiftool(exiftool -AllDates+=1 *.*) to change time of all the photos but in Finder, "Date Created" changes to present day.How can I get real created date displayed in Finder?I understand a new file is created with exiftool so Date Created is present date.    Exif data after shifting the date:   File Modification Date/Time     : 2018:08:24 09:44:32-03:00File Access Date/Time           : 2018:08:24 09:48:10-03:00File Inode Change Date/Time     : 2018:08:24 09:44:32-03:00   Modify Date                     : 2018:08:19 18:46:46Date/Time Original              : 2018:08:19 18:46:46Create Date                     : 2018:08:19 18:46:46A Get Info of an original file<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AgdWe.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>The image was created at 9:04.9:30 I was still taking pictures, not editing or something     I don't get why Apple does not have a "Date/Time Original" or "Create Date" tab in Finder

You can create your own service in automator to provide this info in a popup.Create a New Service in Automator and set it so the service receives image files in FinderAdd a Run Shell Script Action. Pass input as argument. One-liner shell script should be (depending on your path to exiftool) /usr/local/bin/exiftool -b -DateCreated $1Pass the result into a Set Value of Variable Action. Create a new variable (I called mine EXIFDateCreatedAdd a Get Value of Variable and select the variable you created above. Make sure to check the Ignore this actions input (...the first time you use this action, to separate the creation of variables chain from the getting. You can repeat the above steps numerous times to add other files you want to display, but for subsequent Get Value of Variables you would not ignore input).Add a Run AppleScript Action the AppleScript could be:    on run {input, parameters}        set dateCreated to first item of input as text        display dialog "Date Created: " & dateCreated        return input    end runHere's a screen cap of the whole Automator service...<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ca40s.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Save the Service as something like "Show EXIF Create Date" and make sure it is activated in the Keyboard Preferences (Under the Shortcuts tab). The action should now show up when you right click/command click on an image in the finder.Note this can be tweaked to create a pretty decent alternate Info dialog, though this just shows the basics of how it can come together.

I have a problem with the file paths: names with blanks (file not found)

agent
Need more information. Explain in depth what your problem is.

user
I need to replace $1 of `/usr/local/bin/exiftool -b -DateCreated $1` by something that replace spaces between filenames by "\ ".  The pop-up display several File Not Found for each string separated by blanks in file path. `The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error: “File not found: `

agent
replace `$1` with `"$*"`Also I really think you'd be happier just using the "Photos" app or "Lightroom" if you'd rather. Both of these apps manage images beautifully and accomplish everything you are asking for.

user
That produced an empty output. If I '/usr/local/bin/exiftool -b -DateCreated $(echo $1 | sed "s/ /777/g")` all spaces are replaced by 777  and a single "File not found" is in the output as expected, but I don't know how to replace them by `\ `, adding a backslash before each blank space.I don't like Photos very much. In general I don't like apps that encapsulte data in a single large file. Same as Lightroom and Time Machine.For example, in Photos I cannot drag and drop an image to Mail or Thunderbird, I first have to d'n d to a folder and then d'n d to the email I am writing. It has some nice features (like Lightroom) like distribution map with geotagged images.`The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error: “File not found: /Volumes/SeagateFile not found: 2TB/DescargasFile not found: DJI/P4P_51960.JPG”`  This is because there is a blan between `Seagate` and `2TB` and `Descargas` and `DJI`

My MacBook Pro fell and is kinda cracked so since I have warranty from BestBuy, I want to do a complete wipe of the HDD and essentially restore it like it was brand new before I return it. (They’ll probably do it too, but I want to do it myself just to be sure.)I’ve backed up all my data and all I need to do is wipe it.What is the best way to go about this? I want to erase but obviously leave it in a working manner with OS on it etc.I thought I found the answer <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28825/how-do-i-wipe-my-mb-airs-drive-and-start-fresh">here</a>, but that’s for an older OS and the MBA machine.I’m running the latest update of Mountain Lion.

agent
What you should do is similar in concept to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/28827/10639">the answer</a> that you've quoted. The main difference is that your MBP will have the Restore partition on its drive instead of the USB solution for the MBA. Follow the instructions on Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/recovery/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recovery partition page</a>:  Just hold down Command-R during startup and OS X Recovery springs into  action. It lets you choose from common utilities: You can run Disk  Utility to check or repair your hard drive, erase your hard drive and  reinstall a fresh copy of OS X, or restore your Mac from a Time  Machine backup.Since you've already backed up your data, pick the erase and reinstall option, and you'll have a clean copy of OS X installed on the MBP before you bring the machine back for servicing/replacement.

user
hello jw8. Thanks for the response, so will this option leave me with a virgin machine? will it remove EVERY APP, EVERY document etc and just leave the OS running just like i got it when it was new? Thanks in advanced.

agent
Yes, if you choose that option, EVERYTHING will be wiped, leaving a virgin bare-bones OS X install. So make sure that anything you want saved is backed up, but it sounds like you've already done that.

user
ok thanks, thats exactly what i wanted. Will do thanks again.

Forgive the long story, but I have a mix of old knowledge and unfamiliarity with Mac so I don't know what might be relevant. The tldr version is my iMac won't boot.Trying to put op an upnp server: Windows Server on my Leopard Imac I found afterwards that the service planted itself. Trying to quit the process, immediately triggered a sort of reboot screen, and the OS responded, but still the service was not quitted.I tried (I'm a former Win user, and not acquianted with unix - I picked up the command from a forum) with a sudo launchcntl -w to disable the service.By doing this, the mac spinning wheel appeared and nothing responded anymore.I powered down the Imac. When trying to restart the boot reached the gray apple logo screen with the spinning wheel still there, as if it was still trying to disable WindowsServer. The keyboard locked immediately and caps light on.Tried SMC reset, pram reset. As the keyboard was locked each time I tried, no luck. Now, the power button only responds when I first detach the power chord, and reattach it. Inserting the 1st install disk trying to boot from it and run diagnostics didn't work. Always the same screen with the spinning wheel, no keyboard response. DVD is even locked, and cannot eject it anymore.Safe boot of course doesn't work as not one keyboard is accepted.So, I'm dead locked on all sides. Must admit that windows still gave you a chance to boot. This mac is dead on a service disablement process.The damn keyboard locks, so I have no control. I whished there was a reset button like on the TC. What to do ? I have no idea. Backup is not available on Time Machine. Does this need hardware repair or does someone have any ideas.

agent
This is a bit of a mess - but you could do one test to isolate the hardware from the software (and some of the hardware).Power off the Mac and pull the power cord. Disconnect everything you can - keyboard, mouse, etc... Take out all RAM - the manuals are at <a href="http://support.apple.com/manuals" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/manuals</a> if you are not familiar with the safety precautions and tools needed.Then plug in only the power cord and wait a few seconds. If the Mac doesn't start up, press the power button once.You should get three beeps if the machine is healthy.Power it off and put the RAM back in - be sure it's seated well / pushed in completely.Connect only the mouse and power it on holding the mouse button down (button one if there are several).The CD should come out if the hardware is healthy.Shut it down (you can use the mouse or connect a keyboard if needed).Now power on with the shift key held.At this point, if your Mac booted, it's likely everything is fine and you can use Apple's support to troubleshoot the startup issue. If anything doesn't go like I mentioned - you should take a printout of this and what your results were and post here, or seek hardware help. 

user
I managed to get the dvd install disk 1 out in the mean time with a tip from another forum. Holding left button mouse and push eject. It worked.But I gues this will not get me further . I expected an answer without having to pull out hardware. But I understand. I see no screws on the back. But I can have a look.

agent
Feel free to skip the RAM pulling and assume it passes. If that step fails - you won't get past others either. Maybe I should make an edit to the answer...

user
I'm dutch speaking, so I don't follow you. The manuals link does not include the Imac. I disabled beeps, because I didn't like the start up sounds all the time. Sorry.I can only power on when first detaching the chord, placing it back, and the I can power on. Followed your steps. No result.Managed to pull out the ram, and followed your steps. But at boot I heard more than 3 beeps, it repeated beeping. I shut down.  Same problem. It's worse I guess ? No ?

agent
So without the RAM - do you get three beeps?

user
As I explained, without ram he goes beyond 10 beeps and keeps on beeping. Problem remains. Also at the beginning of the problem I still could access the shared folders on the imac from the macbook i'm using now. This doesn't work anymore either, despite linking both macs with an ethernet cable.Thanks for keeping up with me. After a couple of minutes, the mac goes down automatically.Can I still do something myself you think, or do I need to take it to a repair centre ? The only thing I can think of is firewire connect the macbook and the imac. Is this worth buying the cable. At least it could help me recover the shared folders on the Imac, or not ? Then I think I would dispose of the Imac, and go on working with my macbook. What would you do, also considering it's a 2008 model ?

I am looking on eBay for an iPad Pro 10.5” model and in the original Apple website it clearly says that both Pro versions 10.5” and 12.9” comes with Wi-Fi + Cellular connectivity. But many of the sellers in their descriptions point out that it is Wi-Fi only. I do not understand - should the iPad Pro 10.5” come with Wi-Fi + cellular or only Wi-Fi?

agent
The iPad Pro, regardless of whether it's the 10.5" or 12.9" size, comes in two main configurations - one with Wi-Fi only and one with both Wi-Fi + Cellular.The reason many of the sellers are pointing out that the model they're selling is Wi-Fi only is because that's the configuration they're selling.For more detailed information I refer you to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">specs</a> provided on Apple's website. You'll see that there are details for both the Wi-Fi models and the Wi-Fi + Cellular models. For example, you'll see differences listed under Size and Weight and so on.

user
Thanks the answer. May I know why some sellers do not or can’t provide EAN number?

agent
The only way to be 100% sure as to why a particular seller won't/cannot provide an EAN is to ask them. I know in some cases the seller won't actually have the item in their possession (e.g. it's located at a warehouse, they actually organise delivery from a 3rd party, etc). However, if you wanted to know for sure prior to purchase, you'd have to ask them directly.

user
Actually, I do not need the EAN, I was just thinking that maybe they can’t provide them only for fake products.

This MacBook Pro has only two USB-C ports. Since one is used to charge the laptop (the monitor can't charge the laptop), there is only one available port to plug a monitor.Is it possible to connect two external monitors, for example with a hub? If so, can we have 4K resolution for at least one monitor?

agent
To get two external monitors on your 13" MacBook Pro, you needa <a href="http://radnex.us/usbc-multi-port-adapter-power-delivery-hdmi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">video adapter that supports pass-through charging</a>a <a href="http://radnex.us/Cable-Matters-USB-C-Display-Port-Cable-4K" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Type C DisplayPort cable</a>Both displays can support 4K at 60Hz.  From <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Apple's technical specifications page</a>:   Video Support    Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:      One display with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors  Up to two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at millions of colors  Up to two displays with 3840-by-2160 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors  

user
This answer allows to connect one external monitor only. We still don't know when using a hub, if it impacts the maximum resolution (2 monitors into one USB-C channel).

agent
@Kwadz.  Incorrect.  You have two ports.  One gets the hub with power pass through and the second port gets the cable.  To connect two monitors you need to use *both* ports.

user
Got it, so you mean we use one USB-C from the laptop to connect a first monitor and the HDMI of the hub to connect a second monitor. I imagined both monitors connected with Display port, that's why I didn't get you first time. Anyway by using the two ports of the MacBook the max resolution won't be affected. Thanks.

Recently, my MacBook Pro (mid 2012, 15 inch, 10.8.2) has started going into what seems to be hibernate mode after several hours asleep, whether it's plugged in or on battery. When I unplug it, it wakes briefly without me opening the lid (I can tell because the CD drive cycles). If I open the lid, I see it loading the hibernate file before becoming active again. I looked at the output of pmset -g, and see the following settings that might be relevant to this problem:lidwake              1autopoweroff         1autopoweroffdelay    14400standbydelay         4200standby              0hibernatemode        3acwake               0Interestingly, "acwake" is zero, as is "standby". But "autopoweroff" is 1, and the "autopoweroffdelay" is 14400 (4 hours). Looking at the system log from last night, I see these entries:Nov 26 22:36:28 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: sleepNov 27 02:36:30 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer)Nov 27 02:36:30 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wakeNov 27 02:36:30 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: Previous Sleep Cause: 5...Nov 27 02:36:51 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall(preflight 0) start 0xffffff80de079000, 0xffffff80de0b9000Nov 27 08:38:21 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall time: 491 ms...Nov 27 08:38:31 ITHAA1STHOMAMBP kernel[0]: sleepI put the computer to sleep by closing the cover at 22:36. It woke itself 4 hours later at 02:36 and hibernated. At 08:38 I unplugged the power to bring the laptop to work, and it woke briefly.What it looks like to me is that the computer is going into auto power down after 4 hours. But there are some things I don't understand:Why did this start happening recently (within the last week, as far as I can recall, and not associated with any software update)?Why does it wake on power change when "acwake" is 0?Can I just set "autopoweroff" to 0?

agent
To control exactly when your Mac will transition from sleep to hibernate, you can use the following (the delay is in seconds) and you need to have hibernate mode to be set to either 3 or 25 (binary 0011 or 0001 1001):pmset -a standby 1 standbydelay 600You could use different settings and timings for -b battery and -c charger if desired. (Perhaps on power, you disable standby mode, but on battery have a 10 hour timeout.) These switches are documented in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html" rel="nofollow">manual page for pmset</a>. I haven't messed with acwake lately, but in the past the lid proximity sensor of a portable would take precedence and suppress a wake that would have happened if the lid were open.

user
But right now, standby is 0 so I should never be entering standby mode. I think it's doing "auto power off", but I don't understand why. And I don't know what is the downside of changing "autopoweroff" to 0, which might stop that behavior.

agent
Hmm - I've found interesting things running a pair of terminal windows, one with `pmset -g batt` and the other `pmset -g pslog` and then poring over the detailed logs. Hopefully you don't have a hardware error or a voltage discontinuity in the battery as those are going to be the hardest to track down.

user
It's a relatively new MacBook (2 months, more or less). The battery has 20 cycles, and I'm getting the behavior when it is plugged in. So battery seems to be unlikely to be the culprit.

I am trying to create a Windows Bootcamp partition on High Sierra but when I got to select the target disk it tells me that there is no space left on the macOS container. My SSD has 250 GB free space and it has a single APFS container with a single APFS Volume. How can I fix this? The computer is a late 2012 Mac Miniand it has a 16GB RAM and a primary SSD (512GB) and a secondary HDD (1TB).I would like to install Windows 10 to the primary SSD.

This answer is not finished. Please do not edit!This answer is based on the accepted answer to the question <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/314111/boot-camp-assistance-is-stuck-on-create-a-partition">"Boot Camp Assistance is stuck on create a partition?"</a>. Modifications were made to include improvements suggested by <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/286843/user128216">user128216</a> to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/308743/how-to-install-windows-10-into-a-2011-imac-without-using-the-boot-camp-assistant/308812#308812">this answer</a>. Based on the lack of posted questions regarding using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows, I have assumed most users are successfully installing Windows on drives containing APFS partitions. When the Boot Camp Assistant fails, generally the problem is not with the Boot Camp Assistant, but rather with the APFS container. So, the usual solution is to backup your stuff, wipe the drive, and reload everything.   However, if you wish to install Windows without using the Boot Camp Assistant (except for creating the USB installation flash drive), you need to first determine how much space is available for Windows. This can be determined from the output of the command diskutil apfs resizecontainer diskXsY limits, where X is the drive number identifier and Y is the partition number of the APFS container.These are the basic steps needed to install Windows 10 for an EFI boot.  Note: To get a better view of the images shown below, either click on an image or open an image in a new window.Use the Boot Camp Assistant application to copy the Windows 10 installation files and the Boot Camp Support Software to a 16 GB or larger flash drive. A USB 3.0 flash drive would operate considerably faster than a USB 2.0 flash drive.The command below will create the 70 GB "BOOTCAMP" partition on your internal SSD drive. The space occupied by this partition will be used for installing Windows.sudo  diskutil  apfs  resizeContainer  disk0s2  180.8G  FAT32  BOOTCAMP  70GIf you have not already done so, insert the flash drive containing the Windows 10 installation files and the Boot Camp Support Software.Use the command shown below to rename the AutoUnattend.xml file. mv  /volumes/WINSTALL/AutoUnattend.xml  /volumes/WINSTALL/NoAutoUnattend.xmlNext, you need to boot from the volume where the Windows installation files reside. Hold down the option key immediately after restarting on your Mac. Release the option when the Startup Manager window appears. Select the icon labeled "EFI boot". Next, select the arrow below the "EFI boot" label.Open a Windows Command Prompt window, by following the procedure outlined in this step.

For your Mac, the procedure would be the same as the [link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/314111/boot-camp-assistance-is-stuck-on-create-a-partition/314177#314177) I posted in my answer. Although, based on [user128216](https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/286843/user128216)'s comments to this [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/308743/how-to-install-windows-10-into-a-2011-imac-without-using-the-boot-camp-assistant/308812#308812), this procedure has many unnecessary steps which could be eliminated.

I started to post a new answer, then user Zhao user asked the same question as yours.

User Zhao has documented the problem better than you have. It would appear the problem may be with APFS volume reserved space. You might what to add the output from the commands `diskutil apfs list` and `diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 limits`. These commands will not change your computer.

I added the output for the requested information. Hope it helps. Thanks for your help!

I have certain Smart Mailboxes in Mail.app (Mountain Lion, Version 6.3 / 1503) which help me find invoices for my tax declaration. I only need them once a year and would like to archive them for the other 50 weeks, because they clutter my mailbox list.I could edit the rules and note down the search criteria, re-creating the lists once a year ... but I am looking for an elegant solution.Is there something like <a href="http://dougscripts.com/apps/smartsapp.php" rel="nofollow">Smart Playlist Management</a> (app that exports the smarts of Smart Playlists for iTunes) ... only for Mail.app? Any idea (App, Terminal, workflow) is greatly appreciated.

agent
Well, really, a smartmailbox is like a rule that is stored inside a mailbox.I would suggest, creating the criteria for a smart mailbox as a real rule. Mail(menu)>Preferences>Rules(tab).This way, you can just check/uncheck those rules when you want. This may adversely affect the rest of your organizational routines. However, you can choose to move or copy the messages, so perhaps copying could avoid the aforementioned caveat. Or an alternativeisFor me, if I go (in Finder) to /Users/myusername/Library/Mail/V2/MailData  there is a file called SmartMailboxes.plist . You could always drag this out (Mail should not be running), and return it when you need it again.(There are also these associated files:SmartMailboxes.plist.backupSmartMailboxesLocalProperties.plistSyncedSmartMailboxes.plistSyncedSmartMailboxesLocalProperties.plistVersionedSmartMailboxes.plistVersionedSmartMailboxes.plist.backupthat may either need to be moved with, or just deleted. I don't use smart mailboxes at all, just a few dozen rules that I have changed/deleted/had in various forms for years over multiple OS/computer combos.) (Italics indicate a file that is there if you have synced smart mailboxes, which I never have, so that file doesn't exist for me, but does for the OP).as far as a terminal shell script, you would want to edit the relevant plist files with the strings you need, by adding/removing them as need. You will get the strings you need by looking at the files themselves. You might want an app to look at them cleanly though, this could be XCode, PlistEditor, or something lite like <a href="http://barebones.com/support/textwrangler/updates.html" rel="nofollow">TextWrangler</a> if you're not messing around with XCode.Notes: I'm running Mountain Lion with Mail.app 6.2. You should endeavor to always give the software version number of all relevant apps/os's to help the helpers help. I don't know if those files exist in the same way for you (more/less/different name/location), but the place to start for any recent Mac OS X version is the ~/Library/Mail (where ~ is your username/home folder), if your library folder is invisible you can get there by typing in the string in the window that pops-up with command-shift-g.

Thank you very much for the detailed post! I examined options 2) and 3). Seems like 10.8 Mail, `SyncedSmartMailboxes.plist` and `SmartMailboxesLocalProperties.plist` are the two relevant files. Editing the former has no effects unfortunately; I assume the data is cached somewhere else. Even though I LOVE working in the terminal, editing any of these files by hand feels a bit too dangerous for me :)

agent
I understand your reservations, it's not exactly a clean way, as some small change by apple in say 10.8.4 or 10.9 updates could render the script useless or destructive. However, FYI, if you download fseventer( fernlightning.com), you can see temporary files as created, 10.8 does love doing this for each little thing, then proceed with blocking the file(s) updating etc… Also, thanks for pointing out the relevant files. after thought yesterday I pegged those would at least be important for icloud/iOS+OSX/multi-device synching! Also, in '1', remember you can COPY the messages instead of moving!

user
Regarding the relevant files, I have JUST recently upgraded my second Mac to Mountain Lion, and it turns out **all** Smart Mailboxes are indeed synchronized between the same iCloud account on various Macs (neat!). That’s the reason for the `Synced` filename part I guess...

I have multiple volumes on my mac and I just enabled encryption on the other drives. My home folder is stored on one of those drives. Now I can't login because it can't see my home directory, but if I login with my admin account it unlocks the drives and then I can login.How do I add those passwords to my login keychain, so they can find my home directory?I could decrypt my home directory, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having it encrypted. And my home directory is too big to fit on my boot disk.

agent
Make sure you've added your non-admin account to the list of users permitted to unlock the drive. This is accomplished in System Preferences > Security &amp; Privacy > Filevault.<a href="http://one.utsa.edu/sites/oit/OITConnect/mac/MacKB/Pages/Adding%20Login%20Users%20to%20FileVault.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://one.utsa.edu/sites/oit/OITConnect/mac/MacKB/Pages/Adding%20Login%20Users%20to%20FileVault.aspx</a>

user
It wasn't a non-admin account.  It was an admin account that existed exclusively on an encrypted drive.

agent
You said, "if I login with my admin account it unlocks the drives and then I can login" so I based my answer on that.

user
Oh, sorry I did.  The problem also existed for admin accounts that were on the second disk.

I just got a new <a href="http://cougargaming.com/us/products/keyboards/attackx3/" rel="nofollow">keyboard</a>.  How can I remap the FN key on only this external keyboard to option?

Thanks for your answer.  Unfortunately, I'm failing at step 8.  When I press the FN key I see no events in the EventViewer main tab.  (I do see events correctly when I press CMD and CTRL).  So I think the FN key isn't mapped to anything.

Yep, that option is disabled.

I've upgraded my workplace with a new Macbook, but I've run into several problems. One of these problems is iPhone synchronization. Previously, I synchronized my iPhone with a PC notebook. Now I want to sync it with my new Mac, but I don't want to lose all my app data or re-upload all the music, videos, etc.Is there any possibility for me to sync with my Mac and not reinstall apps and re-upload music? I know I can use an iPhone file manager (my iPhone is jailbroken) to search all the saves and then reinstall all the apps and then transfer the saves back to phone, but it'll take too much time. Is there a more elegant way to do it?

agent
You can move your iTunes library from your PC to your Mac.  As long as the persistent id is the same it won't erase the iPhone.You could also just edit the Mac iTunes library to have the same persistent id your PC library did.<a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=2137">http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=2137</a>

user
I've heard about this method. I've reproduced all the steps several time - my persistent ID on Mac is the same as on PC, but, unfortunately, iTunes still asks for erasing data.

agent
Step Nine is important: You can now launch iTunes and connect your iPhone to the new computer for syncing. Select your iPhone from the list of devices on the left. Notice if now select Manually manage music and videos from the Summary Tab you will no longer be prompted to erase your data, nor will the files on your iPhone be grayed out.

user
Finally, I've managed to cope with this problem. I've restarted and everything works fine. Thanks a lot!

I've enabled an NFS share using a tool on my MacBook Pro (aptly called NFS Manager), which has worked before. However I'm on a new network and when my mediaplayer is scanning for network drives it will not find the share. Manually entering the IP and folder does not give any results either. How can I check whether the NFS server is running and what is blocking access?

agent
You can check if the server is running in NFS Manager itself:Hit the Test Server button in NFS Manager:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kpub3.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Enter the IP of the server (either 127.0.0.1 or the interface IP e.g. 192.168.0.5) and hit "Test".<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptpDd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>If the NFS server is running you get the following result:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nemVf.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Some of the ports depend on your configuration. The above example shows the standard ports.From remote you can check this by executing nmap. A running NFS server looks like this:host:~ user$ nmap ipStarting Nmap 7.30 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-12-16 01:26 CETNmap scan report for IPHost is up (0.00015s latency).Not shown: 967 closed ports, 27 filtered portsPORT     STATE SERVICE111/tcp  open  rpcbind1001/tcp open  unknown1021/tcp open  exp11023/tcp open  netvenuechat2049/tcp open  nfsIf your firewall is off, then either your NFS server or client (or both) are configured incorrectly.

user
Thanks klanomath! I've tried and it says there are no NFS servers found. However I notice that the trial period is expired so does that mean that the tool is not functioning anymore?

agent
@LinkeLoutje I don't think there is a trial expiration (at least there wasn't one in the past). It always shows a nag screen though: *A demo mode panel will appear each time you launch the application/you save changes in the NFS configuration. There are no other functional restrictions.* You may have to add some screenshots (like my first screenshot and maybe a screenshot of the "Show Advanced Options..." window...

user
Thanks! I 2 I made the error to browse and select my MacBook from the list instead of entering the IP. The tool shows that v2 and v4 NFS services are running. Now entering the question as to why my mediaplayer is not able to access them...

I have done a terrible mistake and upgraded my macbook pro to macOS High Sierra Developer Beta.I experience multiple malfunction behaviours, including:Missing files right after upgrade.Machine does not go to sleep when closing the lid (this might be the cause for other issues, since the macbook got VERY hot in my bagand shut down forcibly - twice...).Mouse and keyboard does not function after login screen (not even USB mouse and keyboard. I had to connect via VNC to control the machine).Finder won't launch (The application “Finder.app” can’t be opened.).I would like to downgrade back to macOS Sierra (assuming the problems I described are reversible), but to avoid losing all data. Is it possible?

agent
Same as my answer to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286501/no-user-to-login-in-macos-high-sierra/286503#286503">No user to login in MacOS High Sierra</a>, even though it may not be a strict duplicate...I'd suggest nuke &amp; pave, back to Sierra &amp; HFS+, test the disk [as there are many utils that can test HFS but only one that can test APFS] then rebuild from backup.

user
Can you explain / give reference to this "nuke & pave" process?

agent
Start from a [bootable USB](https://support.apple.com/HT201372), reformat the disk back to HFS+, install Sierra, migrate from your backup.

user
OK, I'm backing up my data. Any reason I won't be able to reinstall from internet instead of a bootable disk?

agent
If the disk has been reformatted to APFS at the upgrade, I'm not sure whether you can go back to HFS from internet recovery. Might be worth checking. btw, Time Machine won't let you go 'downhill'. You'll need a backup from before you upgraded. See https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/271104/revert-to-el-capitan for a cautionary tale.

user
Thanks, I think I'll give internet recovery a try after full backup. Will update when I have any findings.

I have a problem with my magsafe 2 adaptor, it has been stopping to work occasionally for a while now. Until now I always managed to get it to work by yanking the cable (in order to unstuck the pins), however now this method is not working anymore. After the usual yanking, I decided to clean both the connector and power plug on my macbook with a toothbrush and cotton. For some reason after that it stopped working completely. I am able to unstuck the pins by softly tapping on the connector with my fingernails but it still doesn't work. I have another non working magsafe 2, which has perfect pins and after cutting the cord now looks like this:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ps3Yi.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>How dangerous would it be, to cut off the non working connector, expose the cables and connect them together by intertwining the stings?Obviously I would isolate the two wires (copper and the other one) with tape and try to make a decent connection. I have done similar shenanigans with audio cables and it has always worked for a while.I will buy another one, but need an urgent solution right now. However, I don't want to break the computer or start a fire over it. 

agent
This is the low voltage side of the transformer, so the risk is far less than working on the AC side. I haven’t heard of anything worse than scorch marks and safely melted plastic on the low voltage side when people shut these cables in a door or roll chairs over them, so I’d say you’re pretty safe if you make sure it works and doesn’t heat up and protect it electrically. The low voltage side has enough power and current to start a fire, that is certain so I’d say you are risking safety if you don’t do it well or there is hidden damage you don’t catch and fix.<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/213200/">Why doesn&#39;t a stripped/cracked MagSafe power cable shock?</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/303768/">Will the &quot;cracked&quot; wire of a MacBook charger eletrocute me</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/95623/">Out of warranty MBP ,Burned Magsafe port and frayed charger cable - repair option and cost?</a>So, if you know this and try a repair, worst case is you pay for new part or someone skilled at electrical work to do a repair if you’re not comfortable with your safety and whatever house you leave this plugged into going forward once you have learned if you can do the repair. The chances of breaking your Mac is low with this since it’s designed to not charge from damaged cords anyhow.Since you probably should try this for science:<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/317601/">Are the silver wires inside the MagSafe cable necessary?</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/302625/">What are specs of this MagSafe wire, and what is its purpose?</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/237025/">What voltage readings should i get from my 60 watt magsafe</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83349/">Specification of MagSafe power adapter coaxial cable?</a>

user
Thanks for the info! Does the copper colored wire look like a shielding wire? Because I only see this and the silver color wire inside. There should be two right?

agent
@user1721135 I’ll edit with another section linking to existing questions here that covertthe pin outs. The MagSafe is three pins, ground - signal - power and it’s mirror image (A-B-C-B-A) so you can reverse the connector and it still works. Your image looks good to me for separating, but I have never done this operation. I’ve always had plenty of spare adapters for a pinch.

user
Thats what I was confused about, its 2 wires but 4 pins.

agent
@user1721135 Bingo - you now have cracked this nut - the center nub is the reflection point for the two wires / exposed twice for 5 connection points total.

user
Many thanks for your links, I did it and it actually worked!

There are several things which need checking here but this is not a direct answer as not all of them might be the issue here.For a working example for macports see <a href="http://mxb.unixconn.com/Blog/Entries/2007/10/22_Auto-startup_of_stunnel_on_OSX.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>Where is stunnel the path is not the same in launchd as it is in a terminal session You can't have sudo in the script as run by root - however in this case you don't need the script just run the execrable directlyThe username is root not ROOT Where do you put the plist file?I would also suggest a daemon should not be run at startup but only when a connection comes in on a socket but that appears to be how stunned is written not an installation problem Although seeing this other <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/238210/237">answer</a> I am surprised that the example plist files I have seen work (and my last comment is more relevant)

user
I put the plist file in /library/LaunchDaemonsThe reason I ran a script is so if stunnel tries to start too early, the script compensates for that by adding a delay for the system to bootI have no idea where the stunnel path is, or how to find it. All I know is that if you run sudo stunnel from anywhere stunnel will start

agent
and the issue is that the path in terminal and launchd differs so one can find it and the other can't so you need to know this. try `type -p stunnel` to find it

user
Thanks, I found  the path. I have tried all the suggestions with no luck. See edit

I am planning on buying a MacBook Pro 15" Mid-2015 (not a used one, but a new one directly from Apple). For reasons of running legacy software I would like to install Mac OS X 10.10 on it. When it came out, this MBP was delivered with Mac OS X 10.10.3.Now, I also know that you can't usually downgrade a system that you newly buy (say downgrade a Late-2016 MBP to OS X 10.10), as it was never available with such an old OS X in the first place.However, since the Mid-2015 MBP was in fact available with OS X 10.10, I am now wondering: Could I downgrade to OS X 10.10 when I newly buy such a machine today?

agent
I assume you expect the 2015 Mac to arrive with High Sierra installed? I state this because in 2015, I could have purchased a 2015 iMac and instead opted for a 2013 model. This 2013 iMac came with the latest version of macOS available at the time, even though that version of macOS did not exist when the machine was made.My best estimate would be that OS X 10.10.3 would work, but OS X 10.10.2 or older would not. So, if you can download Yosemite from the Apps Store, you would get that last release OS X 10.10.5, which should work. Of course, to download from the Apps Store you would have needed to purchase (for free) when Yosemite first was released. I do not believe you can currently find Yosemite in the Apps Store.Another option would be to try downloading OS X using macOS Recovery. I recently tried do this for the 2013 iMac and Yosemite downloaded. This Mac was original built to run OS X 10.8.4. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904" rel="nofollow noreferrer">instructions for using macOS Recovery</a> did say the "the version closest to it that is still available".I should add that I also have legacy software that requires an OS older that High Sierra. I am currently testing running Yosemite in a free copy of VirtualBox. The installation was surprisingly easy. According to the <a href="https://ntk.me/2012/09/07/os-x-on-os-x/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">instructions</a>, your model would have to fake the CPU.

"The instructions did say the "the version closest to it that is still available"." I don't quite understand, the instructions of what? Do I understand this correctly that you were *not* able to download 10.8.4?

agent
@mdomino: I added a link to the web page where the quote came from. Let me know if you still do not understand. I think the quote means Apple **no** longer guarantees you will be able to use the internet to restore a Mac to its "out of the box" condition.

user
Hi David, I took a while, but I received my new MBP now and was indeed able to install Yosemite. See the answer I added. Thanks again for helping in figuring this out!

From single-user mode in OS X 10.5, I want to rundiskutil repairPermissions /but I get an error:Unable to run because unable to use the DiskManagement framework...Is there a way to load the DiskManagement framework or otherwise repair permissions in single user mode?

agent
I suggest running /sbin/mount -uw /   prior to running this command.  My disk was mounted read only and the command below did not work until I mounted it with write permissions.  I was able to successfully restore file permissions using the command below after mounting the disk as writeable.  The command below ran for over two hours.The Disk Utility Repair Permissions command is just a front end for the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/repair_packages.8.html" rel="nofollow">repair_packages</a> program.Use this: /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs

user
When I run that command, I just get "IFDBFilesInGroupOnTarget() = 10000003, -1073742432". It happens in less than a second, so I doubt permissions are actually being corrected since this is usually a 15 minute procedure.

agent
@labyrinth I'm sorry, when I answered this I don't think you specified the OS version. I see now that you are running the ancient version Mac OS X 10.5. This command only works on OS X 10.6 or later. Any chance you could upgrade or is this a PowerPC system?

user
No, no upgrades available or obtainable. As a workaround, I used a 10.5 OS X install disk to boot into the installation screen and ran disk utility from that.

When I install Xcode from App Store, I can compile programs in Xcode as well as command line too. Several command line utilities like clang, make and git all become available when Xcode.app is installed. So I thought that the separate package of command line tools are only for those who do not want a full IDE installed.But to my surprise, one of the linking problems I encountered when compiling MacVim can be successfully solved by installing the command line tools with xcode-select --install. So apparently the Xcode.app and the command line tools differ, at least in subtle ways. What is the difference then? Does the latter have better coverage for all the essentials for programming than the former?Currently I am using Xcode 6.0.1 on Mavericks.

agent
You can see it as:The command line tools are the basic foundation. Many basic tools are needed to compile your Swift/Objective-C code.XCode is the IDE which brings a few additional packages with it.   So the command line tools get sure that the basic UNIX tools are  covered (as GCC for example) to be able to compile and link code.Xcode then is using those basic tools.<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2339/_index.html" rel="nofollow">From the documents:</a>What is the Command Line Tools Package?  The Command Line Tools Package is a small self-contained package  available for download separately from Xcode and that allows you to do  command line development in OS X. It consists of two components: OS X  SDK and command-line tools such as Clang, which are installed in  /usr/bin.

user
But apparently Xcode.app comes with its own command line tools such as `clang`, `git`, `make` as well. Why is installing another copy of these tools necessary to compile some software?

agent
Why apparently? Git and make are additional tools which are not included in the "basic" Command line tools.

user
`git`, `make` are all in the directory `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin` so they are, indeed, included in the "basic" command line tools.

I wrote an import random code, and unfortunately saved it as the module's name I was trying to call. eg. random.pyI believe, but am not sure, that I created the random.py file twice and thus I deleted the random.pyc, twice, that popped up in the file holding all my python programs, after running import random in the terminal, twice. If I didn't create the random.py twice, somehow another random.pyc (besides the first one) was in the file holding my programs and I deleted it. All the people I asked told me to delete the .pyc, and any file with random, random.pyo as its name. I've checked all my user created files, and none of them fit the description.One of them told me to find and clear the temporary cached version of the random.pyc and random.pyo. My question is where on this MAC air Yosemite can I locate a temporary cached version, and how to safely clear it?

agent
use mdfind to locate all the files with that name (you might need to grep -w for the string or use mdfind with a "kMDItemFSName == whatever.py" clause)Once you know where you've sprayed those files, you could either edit it into the question or decide to do a clean install / migrate user data or remove all the python and then patch that together from a clean install on an external drive.It's had to know what specific things you've done, but hopefully a few of the tools can narrow you down to some options.If I were on deadline and just needed to know what version of python was running - I'd brew install python after setting up <a href="https://brew.sh" rel="nofollow">https://brew.sh</a>You'd then have three installations, but the one that runs from the shell is controllable with $PATH and you can be sure it's up to date with homebrew.

user
I'm like a few days new to python, and programming in general. I used your commands and someone else's to find the original .py, .pyo, .pyc and no duplicates. My problem was resolved by simply going to the path that led to the file, starting python, and calling the module. I will backup my system, immediately, though because I was thinking this entire time I screwed up the Python on my Mac. And next time, I will make my post clearer. Thanks a bunch bmike.

@Red Awesome! Welcome and I'm glad you're learning python and the site. Go ahead and answer your question and then accept it after the waiting period is past. That will help others that are new much more than an "expert's" answer will since different abilities need different levels of detail.

@PeterDraexDräxler, in step 7 above, have you turned on the service on the phone itself?

What service on the phone do you mean? I'm connected to a WiFi.It's curious, now it works without changing any settings. This happens to me often. It sometimes works and sometimes does not.

@PeterDraexDräxler, hmmm, that is curious.  That strikes me more as a network issue rather than an iTunes/iDevice issue.  Does your Remote app ever fail to connect?

user
Since I have add an exception to the firewall, I have no problem with the Remote app. Sync fails also when I turn off the firewall completely. It seems to me like iTunes recognizes the iPhone after really long time being on a same WiFi.

Just the other day, I had an iMac issue resolved by a AskDifferent member, but part of the solution pushed me to go from 10.8.4 to 10.8.5.  I am locked to 10.8, due to applications I use that are dependent on it, but I felt it was a good idea to finally take it to the last update of 10.8, which is 10.8.5.  I did it through the 10.8.5 combo installer versus the app store updater.  I also installed the latest security updates.  Now, I'm trying to install the Supplemental update for 10.8.5 and I'm getting an error message.  Here it is:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wLGMd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Any idea what's going on here?  Much appreciated.

Further research tells me that's a specific build for iMacs with NVidia GPUs, & does include the supplemental. I'll add to my answer

user
Just to be clear, this build (12F2560) indicates that my iMac has:1) Combo installer installed, which includes2) Supplemental Update and3) Security Update 2015-006?

agent
It indicates 10.8.5 + supplemental + Nvidia. Strictly, it doesn't say what method you used to get to 10.8.5.

user
Alright, as long as I already have the supplemental update, then I'm ok.  It makes sense, the supplemental would be released for those who had downloaded the combo update before supplemental was available, and then after its available, its rolled into the combo update to make it more simple for those who hadn't updated yet.  Wish the installer error messages were more descriptive, that would solve a lot of issues.

I have two Macs at home which use Time Machine to back up to a shared Time Capsule.  Does anybody know of any tools or methods for other operating systems to perhaps make use of that back-up facility?  That is, does anybody know of a Windows or Linux client for a Time Capsule?  (Even if it's a very limited one.)

agent
Super highly unlikely you'll find something like Time Machine, as that relies on file-system event logging that was custom made by Apple for Mac OS X.  You can, however, mount the Time Capsule's disk drive as a file share using either AFP or SMB and use any program that will back up files to a file share, which is almost any program that backs up to disk, although beware of possible issues relating to ownership and permissions and unflushed buffers. Note that the following setup assumes you are using Airport Utility 5.6 or later but NOT Airport Utility 6.0.  If you are running Lion, 6.0 is installed by default but you can have both installed on your Mac and use both.  You can download Airport Utility 5.6 <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1482" rel="nofollow">from Apple</a>. If your are on Snow Leopard or earlier, you probably already have 5.6.  Airport Utility 6.0 is greatly simplified and <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/01/31/in-pictures-airport-utility-6-0s-missing-features/" rel="nofollow">missing a ton of features</a> that were available in 5.6.You need to explicitly enable File Sharing on the Time Capsule using the AirPort Utility.  From the AirPort Utility, select the Time Capsule, select Manual Setup, click on the Disks tab.  That should present you with the "Disks" pane, which should list the disks in and attached to the Time Capsule.  Note that like Disk Utility, the list is hierarchical, with drive partitions listed under drive devices.  My Time Capsule just has the internal drive with one partition.  (Click on the triangle next to "Time Capsule Disk" if you don't see a partition name under it.)  Click on the partition name an the right panel changes to show you information about it, including giving you the ability to change its name.  This partition name is the root directory name for the SMB share, so make it short and without spaces. You should avoid hyphens, too, as sometimes hyphens are converted to spaces and sometimes spaces are converted to hyphens and it just gets unnecessarily confusing.  Underscores are OK.Now select the File Sharing panel to get to the rest of the configurations you need to set.With Time Capsule firmware version 7.6 and later you have 3 choices for password protection: you can use the same password for file sharing that you use fo Time Capsule, you can use a different password, or you can go all out and set up multiple users, each with their own password (and corresponding ownership and permissions features).  You also want to assign it to a Workgroup if you're using SMB and you want your Linux and Windows machine and the Time Capsule to all be in the same workgroup.  The default workgroup name of "WORKGROUP" is the easiest way to go.To authenticate the SMB client for access to the Time Capsule when you have not set up individual users on the Time Capsule, you can use any (non-blank) username (it is ignored) as long as the password is correct.    

user
Hmm... Interesting.  Just being able to mount it will probably be good.  When I get a chance, I'll have to try an SMB mount, then I can use `tar` for incremental backups from my Linux server.  From Windows the priority is much lower.  Thanks!I can't seem to mount over SMB, it keeps telling me "no such device or address."  I get prompted for a password, and trying the root without naming a share is a different error, so it seems I'm at least hitting the service.  I'm trying shared like `data`, `shared`, and `root` (all of which I saw in various posts on the subject online), each with the same error.

agent
@David, I added a lot more set up information.  Hope that solves it for you.

user
Looks like they changed the disk management interface in the Airport Utility that I have (http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-releases-ios-like-airport-utility-6-0-for-lion/).  There's still an option to turn on file sharing, but there's no hierarchical disk interface.  I suppose there's a likelihood that recent firmware updates have also changed how the sharing works.  I'll keep digging around.  Thanks!

agent
@David, to confirm, you're using a Time Capsule, not an AirPort, right?  Which version of OS X, Airport Utility, and Time Capsule firmware are you using?  No reason not to be on firmware version 7.6.1.  My walkthrough was of Airport Utility 5.5.3 on Snow Leopard.

user
It's an Airport Extreme with a USB disk attached (I wasn't aware there was a significant difference for this case).  OS X 10.7.3, Airport Utility 6.0.  Not sure about the Firmware (I'm at work right now) but I always upgrade when it prompts me.

agent
@David, you need to get Airport Utility 5.6. I updated my answer to reflect this. Airport Extreme with USB disk attached probably works very similarly to Time Capsule, but I have never administered one so I'm not sure there are no subtle (or big) differences.

user
That did the trick, thanks!  Airport Utility 5.6 allowed me to see what I named the share oh so long ago ("Time Capsule"), and now I can SMB mount it just fine.  Thanks for the help!

I'm trying to setup a TeamCity Build Agent on a Mac Mini Server running 10.7.3. I have successfully got it running and building but only if I login and launch the process manually. We'd prefer to have the process kick off at startup which appears to be easily done by putting a plist file in the /Library/LaunchDaemon folder. Unfortunately this doesn't work for us as the process fires off as root rather than as our specified user. We really would prefer to keep things constrained to the user's folder and moreover need access to a keychain to handle the iOS code signing mechanics. Unfortunately, using ~/Library/LaunchAgents doesn't work as that seems to require someone visit the terminal and login -- this needs to kick off from boot and stay running when the user is logged out. Is there a way to launch a process as a specified user on boot?

agent
You can easily run as another user with sudo -u like so:#!/bin/shUZER=jsmithsudo -u "$UZER" /path/to/program/you/want/to/runexit 0Just change 'jsmith' to the appropriate short user name, and then save that as a script somewhere, and call from /Library/LaunchDaemonsRemember that all files in /Library/LaunchDaemons must be owned by root to be run.(I think this is what bmike was suggesting)Another optionHowever, I wrote up a HOWTO for making auto-login more secure:<a href="https://www.rhymeswithdiploma.com/2019/01/09/automatic-auto-login.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Terminally Geeky: use automatic login more securely</a>The executive summary is this:Turn on Automatic loginPut this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tjluoma/70c936b36d099e37ed9bf64c1df8debe#file-com-tjluoma-autolock-on-login-plist" rel="nofollow noreferrer">launchd plist</a> in ~/Library/LaunchAgentsRebootWhat it does:As soon as you login, launchd will throw you back to the login screen using:"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession" -suspendNote that is all one long line.Considering that someone with physical access to your computer has a lot of potential exploits, I consider this relatively safe, but of course everyone has to make their own determination.

Does running sudo -u get keychain access for the user specified?

That I do not know. You could try the `security` tool to see if you can access it that way.

I sometimes have the problem that my macbook won't sleep, even with the lid closed.After some investigation I tracked the problem down to Spotify app; when the app is open, even if no song is playing, my macbook won't go to sleep and eventually go out of battery power.I don't have need of spotify keeping my mac awake (for obvious reason I'm ok with a video player or a game instead); is there a way to ignore its request for preventing sleep without affecting other applications?I know I could quit spotify when not using it, but I am prone to forget it and it's very annoying to find my mac completely drained...EDIT: to be clearer, I am not looking for a solution about Spotify specifically (I could simply uninstall it and forget about it), I am just looking for an option which is the default in both Linux and Windows, that is that the user always overrides any setting when he/she closes the lid.

agent
Your MacBook should always sleep when the lid is closed. If your Mac is not sleeping with the lid closed, this suggests a problem.There are exceptions:Some MacBooks can be plugged into external displays and, once connected, the MacBook's lid can be safely closed without triggering system wide sleep.Previously it has been possible to install a third party kernel extension to override macOS's behaviour and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2389/">stop sleep with the lid closed</a>. Doing this carries risk and should be avoided.Blocking SleepIt is difficult for user space processes to block sleep. Sleep assertions should never block a user initiated sleep, either via closing the lid or requesting sleep from the Finder. Use <a href="https://www.dssw.co.uk/reference/pmset.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pmset</a> to view current power assertions:pmset -g assertions

user
I know the problem with external displays and it's not my case; also I didn't install anything which tampered with energy management (I know tools like Caffeine, but I simply don't need them on my macbook).When the lid is closed the computer is usually off, but I have experienced once or twice when this was not the case: the "prevent sleep" settings acted above it

agent
The behaviour you are seeing suggests a lower level bug in macOS, a problem with connected hardware, or a bug in the hardware of the Mac. This assumes there are no third party kernel extensions installed.

I think I will go the easy way and throw spotify away :-)I will also try to understand if something is wrong with my macbook

I wasn't able to find the info I needed here or on Apple's own forums or via Google, so here goes.I have a MacBook Pro 15" early 2011 model with a 500 GB internal hard disk drive (non-SSD). Currently running OSX 10.8.5 on a 300 GB partition, and Windows 7 via Bootcamp on a 200 GB partition. OSX is under backup via TimeMachine, Windows is backed up manually on an external hard drive as a simple copy.I would like to replace the internal hard disk drive with an Intel DC S3500 480GB SSD.Changing the drive itself should be easy via a guide I've found. But...instead of the 300GB/200GB partitions I currently have, I'm aiming for 400GB/80GB partitions on the SSD. The Windows 7 Bootcamp partition I currently have uses only 70GB, so I'd like it to occupy the 80GB partition on the SSD.Once I'm on the SSD, I will upgrade OSX to Yosemite.Question:I would like to migrate both my current installation of OSX and the installation of Windows to their respective new (differently sized) partitions on the SSD, without having to re-install the OS'es.What steps do I need to take to make this work?

Update 3:There were a two reasons I wanted the output from diskutil and fdisk. First I wanted to check if rEFIt was installed on its own partition. It is not. This leaves either the EFI partition or the OS X partition. The normal (automatic) installation would be OS X, which is backed up with Time Machine. To be safe, you could backup the EFI partition. This is not a problem since it is only 210 MB in size. I usually just make an exact image copy of the entire partition. The command is shown below. The image file efi.img will be stored in the root directory of the OS X partition.sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s1 of=/efi.img bs=10000I do not know if Time machine will backup the "Recovery HD" partition. It is only 650 MB in size. Again, you can just image it to the root of OS X using the command below. My outline did not include migrating this partition to the new disk. Therefore, you probably will never use this file.sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s3 of=/RecoveryHD.img bs=10000 The second reason, for running the diskutil and fdisk commands, was to determine if you are using a GPT or hybrid GPT/MBR partitioning scheme. You are using hybrid GPT/MBR. I assume then that Windows is using the legacy BIOS method of booting and not using the EFI to boot. According to your original post, you intend to upgrade to Yosemite after migrating to the new drive. It just so happens, I am trying to help someone (riznad) who has already done this. See <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/174851/upgrade-to-yosemite-then-triple-boot-problem">here</a>. Upgrading to Yosemite disabled rEFId and created a new "Recovery HD" partition. So you may need to reinstall rEFId. I would not recommend upgrading to rEFInd. I am not sure why you felt the need to use the rEFId boot manager. I use the System Preferences in OS X to boot to windows. Apple provides Boot Camp to boot from Windows back to OS X. On startup, you can hold the alt key to choose an operating system. I rarely need to do that. In riznad's case, rEFId makes sense, that computer has a third partition running the Fedora operating system.If you wish to have a partition writeable by both OS X and Windows, now would be a good time to create it. This can be done by creating the partitions in the following order using the Disk Utility. First create the MS-DOS(FAT) partition for windows 7. This partition will be changed to NTFS by Winclone.

According to the <a href="http://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/c1s1_install.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rEFIt documentation</a>, it is also possible for rEFIt to be installed on a separate partition or on the hidden EFI partition. No mention of being installed on the Windows partition.Assuming rEFIt was installed using the automatic installation, then it should be saved by Winclone followed by Time Machine. But to be honest, I have never used rEFIt. To be safe, it would be useful for you to post the output from the following commands. They can be entered from a Terminal application window. The first one will ask for your login password. This is normal.sudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0diskutil  listdiskutil  cs  listOther than Winclone creating a backup of Windows on you OS X partition, the procedure does not change the files on your original disk. If you wish, you can also backup Windows to a external disk that is HFS formatted (Mac OS Extended Journaled). This way Windows does not have to pass through Time Machine.I don't know where you are living. Where I live, I would go to Microcenter and buy an enclosure for the new disk. I would then plug the enclosed drive into a USB port on the Mac. Transfer everything over. I would also boot OS X on the the enclosed drive and test things out. From my understanding, you can not boot windows. You might be able to from Parallels. I have never used Parallels. I would then remove the drive and return the enclosure for a full refund. (Actually, have done this a few times with 3.5" drives.) The drive could then be installed in the MacBook Pro.If you proceed, it would be a good idea to run CHKDSK on the windows partition before backing up with Winclone. CHKDSK (Check Disk) has be around since the original IBM PC-DOS 1.0. The best way to do this is to open a Command Prompt window as an Administrator under Windows 7 and enter the command:fsutil  dirty  set  c:After entering the command, reboot (restart) Windows. It usually is not necessary to see the results, but if you wish, I will post how to do so using the event viewer. (You can also watch the screen during boot up)I can outline the basic steps using the <a href="https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/winclone" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Winclone</a> product.Purchase, download and install Winclone to your OS X partition.   Use Winclone to backup Windows to your OS X partition.Make sure OS X is backed up to Time Machine.Install the new diskDo a internet recovery boot. This involves hold the cmd-alt-R keysdown at startup and booting over the internet.Partition the new disk using the Disk Utility. Format the OS Xpartition as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" and the  Windowspartition as "MS-DOS (FAT)".Restore OS X using time Machine.Reboot the computer to the new OS X partition.Run Winclone to restore Windows 7 back to the new 80 GB partition.Drag the Winclone Windows 7 backup to the trash to recover the space on the OS X partition (Optional).You are done.If you wish to proceed, let me know. Also, if klanomath happens to post, I would recommend any of his solutions. He has more experience with Time Machine than I have.

user
Thanks David for outlining the steps! Very useful! When I currently boot into Windows, I do it via a menu that appears at boot, allowing me to choose between OSX and Windows. I believe the menu is called "rEFIt" or something - someone I knew installed that one for me years ago. If I restore Windows using Winclone, will it install that "rEFIt" menu for me? (Also, will my OSX Parallels app still be able to run it? And will the files on my Windows partition be accessible from the Finder like I have it now?)Thanks for the explanation David! I've added an update to the question with the info you requested. Also, when setting the dirty bit using fsutil, I assume the disk check will then happen only on the first Windows boot after that, i.e. the dirty bit is then cleared again automatically. Correct?

agent
You are correct.

user
I believe I understand your guide to the whole procedure, and I'd like to follow it. So final thing, just to be safe as you said: you see nothing in the command output that would jeopardize the operation?Thanks a lot David for your detailed answers! It'll probably be a couple weeks before I do the procedure. I think my reason for rEFIt was that I'd maybe install Linux, but now I have no intention to do that - I'll just go with the alt-key during boot, as you mention, after going Yosemite. No idea whether there's anything worth saving on the "Recovery HD" partition - don't know what that one's for, but I'll back up both partitions EFI and "Recovery HD" as you suggest, to be sure. Thanks for your help, I'm ready to close the question now, unless you have any final point I should be aware of.Wait... if "Windows is using the legacy BIOS method of booting and not using the EFI to boot" as you assume, would that be a problem on the SSD? (Please prioritize riznad's questions over mine, as he seems to be in trouble)

How to I make Preview use freehand mode by default while I'm drawing? It seems to want to smooth everything everytime.

agent
By default the drawing engine in Preview can't be changed (in El Capitan or earlier) as it's a vector base drawing system. So it will always have some level of smoothing applied to it based on the algorithm Apple is using.You can however turn off some of the smoothing for documents that store the drawing in vector format like PDF, but this will have a minimal effect at best for most drawings.If you want to try turning off the vector smoothing under Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan.Go into the Preview -&gt; Preferences... and choose the third tab PDF.Un-checkmark Smooth text and line art.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QnkyZ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Beyond that there isn't a way to turn off the math that drives the drawing tool in Preview.

user
This doesn't appear to have any effect.

agent
@Daniel like I said in the first bit, you can't really change the Preview drawing image. The smoothing change is only going to make a small change in the line art quality. The vector math for drawing is set by Apple, and there really isn't any control over the soothing in Preview other than what I already talked about sorry to say.

user
Any recommendations for alternative software that will let me draw on a PDF?

agent
@Daniel I think you're going to run into the same issue with most all of the PDF apps out there. Every one I have on my system does the same smoothing (at different levels) to freehand drawing. This is because of the PDF standard. If you want to draw in pure pixels (raster), then you will want to look at another program. Other PDF apps you could try are: FoxIt PDF Reader https://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/pdf-reader/ , PDFill Editor https://www.pdfill.com , or PDF Draw Pro http://machsoftwaredesign.com/pdfdraw.html. There are lots of other ones out there.@Daniel if you want an inexpensive drawing app that will let you read in and draw on a PDF, and save it back out as a PDF (usually NOT maintaining most editable elements) then look at Pixelmator (http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/) or Affinity Designer (https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/). Pixelmatr will turn the image completely to a raster (pixel based) image, and save it out as a PDF. Affinity Designer will read in the PDF, and keep some if not all the PDF elements in tact when you save it back out.

user
I'll just put up with the smoothing before I shell out more than $5 for a piece of software.

I often want to make a picture available on the internet, without wanting it as part of my Twitter stream or Facebook account etc.  For example, posting a screenshot to a thread on a forum or just to include in an email without sending an attachment.I'm happy for the pic to be public, but don't necessarily want it to be associated to me if people stumble across it, or have it included with photos I actually care about on services like Flickr etc.  I just want to throw it up to an image hosted and dump it without a trail, in the easiest and quickest way possible.The closest I have found is an app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/picup/id354101378?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Picup</a>, which throws a photo onto Imgur without any logging in and captioning etc etc.  If it also had the ability to scale it down to half sized it may be enough, but it doesn't, and as such pics are full sized which increases upload speed and makes the picture potentially too large for sensible linking to on sites that won't auto-scale it.So, what I am after will ideally meet the following criteria:Allow me to take a photo, or use a camera roll imageResize it automatically via a preset preference (Say max 400 in largest dimension)Upload it to am image hosting service that does not require me to have an account or log inPresent me with the resulting URL in a way that makes copying it simple, perhaps via a big fat COPY URL button, or automatically selecting the text etcOptional - provide links for common uses of the URL - compose email, send tweet etc.Imagine a scenario; I see a ridiculous haircut in Wallmart, I want to snap it, throw it up, send it to friends, then abandon it so I never have to care about who finds it by accident later with my name against it, and never need to go pruning such childish photos from my genuinely useful and wanted pics such as those in Instagram etc.

agent
You sound like you're looking for a native app, but the web app you access at <a href="http://imgur.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://imgur.com/</a> sounds like the feature set you want. Upload from your camera roll, not linked to you, and you get a url you can paste wherever you want.

user
That would work, a=only it doesn't scale the image down, and the job of subsequently copying the url is a little messy.  Also, it will only allow for existing photos, not let me take a fresh one.

agent
I don't get the "fresh one" problem. As soon as you take a picture, isn't it available in Photo Roll? Obviously you can't post a photo that doesn't exist, but as soon as you use the camera app to create the picture, it's available for posting.

user
It's the flow, if I need to take a quick snap of something, and want to throw up a reduced size version onto a site without needing a login, without it being part of a gallery of all my other pics, and without the source sitting in my camera roll or photo stream leaving me to neeed to remember to remove it.  The end result I am loking for is quick and dirty disposable photo uploading, minimal effort, minimal management.

I have gotten along quite well without Flash for a long time.  But recently I had reason to install it for one particular website.  Since it is installed, I figured I'd have it prompt me if another site wants Flash.  But I've been asked to enable it for every website, almost all of which have worked fine without it and work fine after I say "never for this website."I've tried FireFox on a few of those sites, with no apparent difference from before.Should I report it as a bug?  Can I put a stop to it, and if not, how do I remove Flash without breaking other things?

agent
Go to Safari Preferences, Security tab, and click Plug-In Settings. Select Flash Player on the left, and ensure that "when visiting other websites" is set to Off, rather than Ask.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yAqh.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
I don't want it off.  If a site needs Flash, I _want_ it to ask.  It should not be asking for a site that doesn't need Flash.  Like it did a couple years ago on another Mac.

agent
Oh,ok... your question said you'd installed it for one particular website, so I assumed that was the only one you cared about (I see you've clarified that now). In that case there's either something else weird going on, or all those websites really do have an optional Flash component for an ad or a tracker or something else you're not seeing. I just set that option to "Ask", browsed around to a bunch of different websites, and so far I haven't been asked once.

user
Hmm.  After reading your comment, I visited three sites on different domains that I maintain myself (but hadn't recently visited.  None of them asked for Flash.  So I guess there are a lot of sites that stupidly request Flash when they don't actually use it.   Grrr.  With a little extra detail, that makes your answer acceptable.

I noticed a clicking noise comming from the underneath the keys around the number 5, 6 and 7 (make a circle with your thumb and pointer finger around those numbers, and thats where the sound is comming from). It mainly does it when I tilt the MBP back and forth or left and right. I turned the computer over and noticed the black foot on the front (nearest the spacebar, not the screen) left side was gone. The one on right has been missing for a while but it has a black "stick" in the center where the hole is.. But the one that I noticed is missing today doesn't have that "stick" in the hole and I can see right into the computer. I have put black duct tape over it to prevent any dirt or anything from getting in there. The noise has actually stopped, unless I tilt it forward nearly upside down..1.) Does someone has any suggestions on what I can do to fix this myself?2.) Is this harmful to the MBP?3.) Is it okay that I put the duct tape on the "feet" holes tempararily?4.) Should I try taking the bottom panel off my MBP and see if that little black stick fell inside?P.S. - Please don't suggest going to an Apple store or Genius Bar because I'm in Laos (South East Asia) and there is none of which anywhere near me. It will be 20 days before I get somewhere that has an Apple store. Do you think the computer should be okay until then?-Macbook Pro 13" 2009, Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5.

agent
The feet help air to get under your Mac and cool it, which is essential because heat destroys just about everything a computer needs to keep working, like the processor or hard drive. The clicking noise is probably your internal harddrive beginning to fail. You should back up your data immediately and prepare to replace your hard drive, as clicking is often a good indicator that the drive is about to stop working. You can check the drive's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T." rel="nofollow noreferrer">SMART</a> status using Disk Utility.app, but it may not report anything amiss until its too late.You can find detailed instructions on checking the drive's SMART status <a href="http://pondini.org/OSX/DU9.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, but the meat of it is accomplished just by stealing their image, which I'll link to below.

user
How do I check the drive's SMART status..? I'm in Disk Utility and I dunno what to do??

agent
@Jake - see my changes; you don't have to do much, just select your boot drive and look at the bottom right of the Disk Utility window.

user
It says that the SMART status is "verified"...The clicking noise actually hasn't happened since I put duct tape over the "feet" holes... Any idea why that might have stopped it?

agent
If it was the hard drive clicking, it does not necessarily mean the hard drive will definitly fail, but is only an indicator that it is a [good possibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_of_death#Hard_disk_drives), and is likely a part of some mechanical process to prevent catastrophic failure. On the wiki page linked, there is an audio example of what hard drive clicking sounds like in ogg format... which might be difficult to listen to from a mac without [vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html).

user
Okay, well I just listened to that on the link, and it is nothing like that. The click on mine sounds more inconsistent and less like a mechanism trying to work. Kinda sounds like it might be the fan or something bouncing in the fan now that I've heard that noise on the link.. and if it was something in the fan, it might explain why it's not happening anymore, because maybe it dislodged itself.

We have a few airport's and an airport express here at my work, and I would like to bring them into my Nagios monitoring more closely. Right now they are only being monitored by ping. I would very much love to be able to ssh to it as we do to the other WAP's, so that I could monitor the users connected and maybe even some basic signal quality stuff, but other answers are getting me thinking that ssh just isn't an option for the Airports.One thing I have found is a couple of posts referencing networksetup. From what I can tell it seems to give some degree of function not only for getting information out of the router, but also performing actions such as a restart. The one problem is - it's obviously a binary only available on the mac terminal.I can't co-opt one of the few macbook pro's we have just to proxy requests to the Airports, and I'm not aware of a way to virtualize OSX. Does anyone know of a port of the networksetup command for some other distribution (if it was ubuntu it would be ++good)? Or perhaps an alternative solution to be able to get basic information from and perform basic actions on an airport (I really can't think of any actions needed other than the restart).Edit: I just got momentarily excited when I saw that there was a airport-utils package - sadly it would appear that this does not support any command line options, it's GUI only.

agent
You're asking a lot of different stuff here.Here's the question I am going to try to answer:"How can I bring my Airport devices into my Nagios monitoring more closely?"OK so first of all, Nagios supports SNMP and (most?) Airport devices <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/node/493" rel="nofollow">support SNMP</a>.  So "all" you have to do is configure the Airport SNMP settings and then set up Nagios to ingest the data.Unfortunately the current version of the Apple's Airport Utility (6.3.1) removed the interfaces to the SNMP settings in the Airport.  You can still download the old version (5.6.1) from Apple but the installer for the old version of the Airport Utility refuses to run on Mountain Lion! However it turns out that it is only the installer that is broken in ML!Some crazy genius has written and <a href="http://frank.is/mountain-lion-and-the-old-airport-utility/" rel="nofollow">made available</a> an Automator workflow that works around this and allows you to install the old version of Airport Utility.  I just tried it and it worked.  Was then able to use it to set the SNMP settings of my Airport devices.If this ends up working for you and you accept my answer, you should consider rewriting the question so that the question and the answer match.

user
Hey, thanks very much for taking the time. I think what I am seeing here is that SNMP would give me the monitoring data in a pushed manner (from airport->nagios), but this wouldn't allow for any commands sent back to the airport (such as one to restart), is that right?

agent
Not an expert in Nagios or SNMP but I believe that is correct.

user
Hmm, I'm gonna wait it out to mark an answer, see if there's another response which covers that too, but thank you again!

agent
Did you find a solution to your issue?  If so it's acceptable to post and accept your own answer.

user
I'm working on using what I can find in the airportutils package to kludge my way through it - but I've also been given other priorities so it's tough to say when this will be finished.

I am trying to get my head around the difference between the Apple products above.To me, Apple VNC (or rather generic VNC clients) perform the same basic function as Remote Desktop implementations (Apple, Microsoft, Citrix, etc), and various Screen Sharing apps.Also, it seems that Apple Remote Desktop can push scripts down to clients, and change some settings, much the same way as Apple Remote Management, and Remote Events seem to infer they do, by name.Moreover, Remote Login is something (unless you wanted a shell) that you would do as part of a Remote Desktop / Screen sharing / VNC operation, no?

agent
You are correct, VNC is a simpler version of Remote Desktop (note: Remote Desktop uses the VNC protocol in addition to adding a lot more features)Remote Desktop offers more management features; ability to black out host computers screen, push updates, file transfers etc (think TeamViewer but by Apple).<a href="http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/</a>VNC doesnt have any of these options, its just a simple way to access a remote screen.Remote Login allows you to SSH to a remote computer (command line - you dont see the remote desktop)eg You may want to run a command on a remote computer, you could connect using VNC and open terminal or instead you could remote login via SSH and run the command without actually interacting with the screen of the remote computerUpdated to include @Wheat Williams notes below

user
Wheat Williams, the point of that sentence (incorrectly quoted) was to point out that I believed they are similar in nature, hence why have two products which are subsets of each other. Further, this is not about the standards, closed / open source, price, this is about the functional differences.@OrangeBox - Thanks. If I may - A) Is there any difference between Apple VNC, and Apple Screen Sharing? B) Care to propose any idea as to why both Apple VNC and Apple Remote Desktop are available concurrently? C) Is Apple screen sharing, part of Apple VNC, or are they yet another "double up" in functionality? D) What is Apple Remote Events, and lastly (sorry) E) How does Apple Remote Management fit into the picture. Thanks again for your time!

agent
a) Enabling screen sharing allows VNC connections. You can use the built in VNC client in OSX to establish a connection.b) Screen Sharing is free to use but lacks any features. Remote Desktop is paid software because it has more features.c) Apple Screen Sharing IS Apple VNC.d) Simply allows [Apple Events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_events) to be forwarded to another computere) Apple Remote Management is used for Apple Remote Desktop - ARD does more than just screen share so you need to enable it specifically@wheatWilliams feel free to correct me if I'm wrong :)

user
Thanks @Orangebox. So what "relationship" does Apple Remote Management and Apple Remote Desktop have exactly. Is one the host service and the other the client, or is Apple Remote Management the console for Apple Remote Desktop and Apple Screen Sharing / Apple VNC? Also, forgot to ask what Apple Remote Login, and Remote Desktop Dashboard Client are? Thanks once again for your help.

agent
Unfortunately this is not possible with the native OS. This is possible though of you have 2 speakers and both compatible with AirPlay 2. Whilst not giving the exact same effect it is similar in some ways to what you want. Any device with this logo on the packaging should work with AirPlay 2.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnC79.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Also, your iPhone must be running iOS 11.4 or later.

Thanks for your answer. I'm running on the last iOS but I'm not sure my Speaker is compatible.

In OSX would it be possible to change the background colour and/or text colour of the address/search bar input field of a browser (Chrome, Safari, etc)? Not just the highlight colour (System Prefs > General > Highlight color) but as a permanent colour change, independent of focused or highlight state. Mock up attached.I'm completely new to OSX/app development and have no idea if this style setting made in the operating system or in the browser app? (Or if it's even possible to change at all). I'm currently interested in the possibilities of how to achieve this - with the ultimate end goal to be able to toggle the override on or off when necessary.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRFDB.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

The Search Bar highlight colour is controlled by a System Preference.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AqGd4.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>System Prefs > General > Highlight color <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1QJg3.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>This works for Safari &amp; Chrome - though it also changes your highlight system-wide.

user
That setting only affect the highlight / colour when focused. I'm after a way to change the colour when inactive or focused. Basically, for it to not be black text on a white background.

agent
Unfocussed selected is grey, unfocussed unselected is white, presumably also system-wide, as it's part of the same structure.

I had serious problems from two versions of Xcode on the same machine. I removed all Xcode app instances &amp; many other non-System 'xcode'-related files, then reinstalled the app (4.6.2), fixing my original problem. But xcodebuild and xcode-select are still not available, which I need to run PhoneGap for iOS.  Within Xcode, the Preferences => Downloads => Command-line Tools item is marked "Installed", with no option to delete or re-install. I tried removing xcrun, but that didn't work. How do I fix this?

agent
The command line tools are installed like other OS X packages, so you may need to delete the receipt file from the receipts database (which used to be trivial since you could delete the file from /Library/Receipts but now is more complicated and needs a short article on the receipts database).Rather than mess with that, why not just download the stand alone installer and wait for a new version of Xcode to clean up your receipts database for you?<a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools">https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools</a>This URL is fairly open (even the search engines can index it) but you might need to make a free Safari or free Mac developer account to log in and get this package.If this happened to me, I'd simply change my Time Machine to exclude system files and then install a new OS onto a spare volume. I'd make a junk admin user that I'll delete and use that user to install Xcode and the command line tools and then finally restore from Time Machine. As long as everything worked, I'd clone that to my main drive or repeat the wipe/reinstall process - whichever is easier for you to perform.

Forgot to mention that I tried that; xcodebuild still unavailable in standard executible dirs. There is one in Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild.

agent
`xcrun` will tweak your path if you have multiple toolsets installed. You could just `mv` those binaries into /usr/bin if you wanted a quick fix. Again with WWDC running as I type this, a new version of Xcode should drop within a day or two...

user
Thanks. Are you suggesting copying all the files from that dir?

agent
Here's a paste of /usr/bin from a clean Mac with the latest command line tools. You can diff it with your listing (ls -la /usr/bin) http://cl.ly/PYyh to see what needs to be copied and what Apple left in the Xcode.app /Developer folder.

Since re-installing OS X (10.8), every time I plug in an iOS device iTunes opens up and shows an error message:  iTunes could not connect to the iPhone "..." because it is locked with a passcode. You must enter your passcode on the iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.I plug in various devices all the time, just so I can charge them. I do not want them connected to iTunes, I definitely don't want iTunes storing a copy of the device's passcode (or however that works) on my mac, and some of the devices plugged in aren't even mine.How can I stop this from happening? It doesn't happen when I'm booted into 10.7 on the same mac, with the same iOS devices.I already have "Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically" enabled in Preferences.EDIT: this particular device also has "Open iTunes when this device is connected" turned off, so it seems to ignore that setting.

agent
In iTunes there is an option to prevent the app to launch when a device is connected to your computer.  Open iTunes > Clic on a device in the sidebar > Scroll down to the "Options" section.Then you have to make sure this little checkbox is un-check:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/unMf4.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>(source: <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/2u3h1R2Q3L0k2n451f1W/Image%202012.07.26%2002:08:45.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">f.cl.ly</a>)  If the problem still occurs after that, come back here !

user
That was already unchecked. Also, I need this to work on other people's devices as well including ones where they might have this setting enabled. As part of my work, I regularly plug other people's devices into my mac.

agent
I Think that this settings is save for your computer only and it don't affects other computer, but i might be wrong.

user
It was already turned off and I just did a clean install. So it must be stored on the device.

When using Yosemite and El Capitan, I set up a folder where screenshots are sent by default. Once screenshots were taken, they'd be added to the bottom of the folder, all in a grid and such.Ever since I upgraded to Sierra, however, the screenshots, even though sent to the right folder, are put in some random position in it. As a result, they get piled up on top of other screenshots that were already there. Is there anyway of fixing this? What could be causing it?I realized this is happening on all of my folders, not just the screenshots one. Whenever I used to add new stuff to a folder, it'd get sent to the bottom on that folder, and now it gets piled up on top of the item on the left side of the fifth row (the bottom-most row on the window before I resize or maximize it).

agent
You need to set your folder to Arrange by some criterion - name, date etcSelect the open window, then View Menu > Arrange by > <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2vrX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Alternatively, use Clean Up By to sort them once, then  Cmd ⌘   J  to get the Folder Options, select elect Arrange By None &amp; Sort by > Snap to Grid.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/35ww6.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
That's not what I'm looking for. That effectively splits and groups the images according to whatever criterion I choose. What I want is just for the new images to appear at the bottom of the folder, like they used to, instead of piled up in random places.

agent
Added an alternative method, though I'm pretty sure Arrange by Date would have done what you wanted.

user
Was just trying this alternative method, and the images still seem to be piled up, though trying to move them sends 'em to the bottom at once — not sure what's up with that. As for _arrange by date_, the last time I tried it it reversed the order of the images, putting the most recent at the top — there's seems to not be a way of reversing the order.

agent
yes, date will sort new to the top. The alternative method requires you to Clean Up by something once, which will them move them from their random locations, then none & snap should do what you want, assuming you don't manually drag anything in there, otherwise it will go wherever there's a space.

user
Either I'm misunderstanding something, not conveying something properly, or the behavior since the upgrade to Sierra indeed changed in someway. I have the "sort by snap to grid" option chosen, but new images keep getting added on top of others. The Finder window shows, by default, 5 rows of images before scrolling, and for some reason new images get added on top of the leftmost image on the 5th row, always. Doing a simple "clean up" (by nothing in particular) sends the images to the bottom most times, but it sometimes sends the one on the back instead... Trying to move sends the new one down.Actually, just realized this is happening on every folder, not just the screenshots one. Just downloaded a pdf to another folder, and it got added on top of the leftmost item on the 5th row (meaning the bottom most row without expanding the window or scrolling) :\

I got a new MacBook Pro from late 2016, MacOS Sierra, 2 thunderbolt 3 ports.In this machine I need to plug in one external monitor via HDMI, and a few USB devices (mouse and keyboards). For this I bought an adapter that plugs in to the Mac's USB-C port, and supplies two USB 3.1 ports, one HDMI port and a power delivery for the USB-C power supply. The adapter is: Promate uniHub-C (<a href="https://www.promate.net/products/unihub-c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.promate.net/products/unihub-c</a>)The power supply works, when I plug in the power cable to the adapter, the computer charges.The HDMI works with another monitor.My external USB hard drive works, so the mouse/keyboard issue feels strange.When I have a USB keyboard plugged in, and an external hard drive - the System Report > USB shows as follows. The keyboard and the hard drive are both plugged in to the uniHub-C.In the finder I see the hard drive though, seems to work well.Screenshot showing the System report<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORxNs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Screenshot showing that the finder can find the connected hard drive<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/65CFN.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Here is the problem: the USB slots doesn't seem to do much. When I plug in mouse and keyboard in the adapter, nothing happens. I was worried that perhaps I need another kind of USB-C => USB 3 adapter for regular USB devices to work, but I can't confirm that.How can I verify I have an active connection in each USB slot?

agent
It looks like this particular product (uniHub-C) has its own idea about compliance to USB specifications. The designers seem to cut off the USB 2.0 part of the VIA hub design. First sign is that their marketing blurb doesn't mention support for legacy (HS, FS, LS) devices, which is strange - in marketing, more is merrier. Second, the web page shows some goofy "USB Super-fast" logo, which in no way corresponds to the official USB-IF certification logo,<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/31PBU.png" rel="noreferrer"></a>I suspect you fall for a wrong device.

user
This is concerning indeed. My hard drive is probably USB3, it's a MyPassport. So you think that USB2 protocols doesn't work with the uniHub but since the hard drive is USB3, that's the reason that one shows up?

agent
@miphe, why don't you try any known good USB 2.0 pen drive in your hub? I am sure you have several on them in your drawer...

user
I have confirmed that this is the case. I purchased a USB-C => USB 2.0 HUB/Adapter (http://tinyurl.com/y79emk4j) and the components that didn't work with the Promate HUB does indeed work with this one. Thank you.

I'm completely new to development for Mac OS X but I want to have a Mac desktop app for my  own small project. What I have in my mind is to have web application (will use the same app running on the web) running in some kind of wrapper window and pack everything in .app file so it could be run just by clicking icon and will not run in a browser.So in short - I have web application written in html+css+js and want to run in some kind of wrapper and make it look and act like desktop app. The best way to do that?Do I need to write some kind of wrapper app in Objective-C which basically will have window and will use WebKit to load my files? Or maybe there is already a solution for it which could be used?The best example I can find quickly of this is <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow">http://brackets.io/</a> where a web app is packaged to look like a compiled app and runs on my Mac.

agent
You could also use <a href="http://fluidapp.com/" rel="nofollow">Fluid</a> to create a site-specific browser. SSBs often feel more like restricted versions of browsers than standalone applications though.One example of a Fluid application is <a href="https://github.com/drdrang/drtwoot" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/drdrang/drtwoot</a>.

My understanding is that it is impossible to change the default width of the List View "Name" column in Finder on a Mac. To be specific, I need to increase this width.Is there a third-party program that can accomplish this?If so, please specify if the "Name" column width can be set on aper-folder basissystem-wide (all folders basis)or both.OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. 

agent
On the latest version of Sierra, in list view in a Finder window, holding the option key while double-clicking the divider between the “Name” column and its adjacent column. then releasing the option key and closing then reopening Finder to that same folder… the width of your name column retains its new set value in list view.  This only works on a per folder basis You can set custom widths for your name columns in list view for any folder of your choosing.Here's the kicker though!!  I believe if you resize the finder window itself, this will reset your custom column widths.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eK7GQ.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>I think you can also Alt + Drag, Instead of Alt + double-clicking

user
I'm still on El Capitan for now, but I will try your solution after upgrading to Sierra.

agent
I think my solution works on El Capitan as well

user
This does not work on El Capitan. If I hold the _option_ key while double-clicking the divider while in List View, the full width of the "Name" column is temporarily maintained (that is, only while this window is open). If I close this window, and then re-open the very same folder, the "Name" column is in the truncated state again. I did not re-size the Finder window, at any point.

I would like to recover/restore only *.GIF files from my most recent backup. They were accidentally deleted from everywhere in My Computer instead of just the intended folder. I currently have only 6 GB of free space (they took up about 1 GB, and only ~4000 files).If I try selecting the most recent backup in Time Machine for recover, it starts by counting up to >20,000 files and then quits saying there is not enough space and stops. If I try to specify the Users folder, and kind:GIF in the most recent backup in Time Machine, the files remain gray color and not selectable.Am I doing something wrong, or is this not possible?Let me know if more info is needed.NOTE: I edited to change "recover" to "recover/restore" - I didn't stop to think about the difference in meaning. If possible I need them back where they belong and there were so many locations - including applications and webpage downloads - I doubt I could figure it out myself.Here is my most recent backup.

It seems like you will have to use the Terminal:Mount your Time Machine disk. It will be located in /Volumes/myTMdisk/.Start the TerminalType rsync -av --dry-run --include="*.gif" --include="*/" --exclude="*" /Volumes/myTMdisk/Backups.backupdb/myMac/Latest/myDisk/Users/me/ /Users/me/Desktop/allmygifs/ Replace myTMdisk, myMac, myDisk, me, and /Users/me/Desktop/allmygifs/ with the appropriate values. You can use the tab key  while typing to auto-complete your path.If your pathname contains whitespaces or special characters, put it in quotes, e.g. rsync -av --dry-run --include="*.gif" --include="*/" --exclude="*" "/Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/Backups.backupdb/david914’s MacBook Air/2015-08-30-221221/Macintosh HD/Users/david914/" "/Users/david914/Desktop/allmygifs/"If you want to restore the files into the original locations, use rsync -av --dry-run --include="*.gif" --include="*/" --exclude="*" /Volumes/myTMdisk/Backups.backupdb/myMac/Latest/myDisk/Users/me/ /Users/me/. I would recommend another backup before doing that. Then replace Latest with the respective timestamp.In case you get file permission errors (e.g. Permission denied and code 23 error as described <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/30676">here</a>), you may have to use sudo in front of rsync. But now you will really need to backup first. Ideally backup to a different disk or make another copy of your TM disk.Once you are sure everything works, remove the --dry-run argument after rsync -av to actually write files.Enjoy!

user
So @n1000 does this just copy all of them into a single folder I specify? I'm trying to recover/restore them to their original locations - the way that I'm hoping TIme Machine knows how to do (see update). So one **can not** do extension-specific restores with Time Machine? There are GIFs all over the place,

agent
I did not find a way to do it directly in TM. My filters actually do not work there. Also I am not sure if you could restore recursively, i.e. into the corresponding folders.

user
Tried `--dry-run` got this, which I'm guessing might be OK? `sent 29 bytes  received 20 bytes  98.00 bytes/sectotal size is 0  speedup is 0.00rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/main.c(992) [sender=2.6.9]` will take your wise advice and do a backup now before executing. Thank you very much @n1000 !!!added autocomplete and cd results at bottom of question - bitten by the single quote maybe?

agent
Yes - it's the single quote your path contains `’` not `'` in `david914’s MacBook Air`You're welcome. See also my comment to your question above. You should get warnings in the output if files are skipped due to permission errors. One question at a time - just use `tab` ;)

user
DONE!! :)  I think I should try to tidy up my question a bit? But that will have to wait a half-day,  ditto my previous thanks @n1000. For the record: `sent 1502930485 bytes  received 42564 bytes  17999677.23 bytes/sectotal size is 2536747693  speedup is 1.69`

I have a 2012 Mac mini running the latest Yosemite that I use as a server for file sharing, FileMaker, calibre, Time Machine and Plex. The Finder reports that the internal drive has a capacity of 499.25 GB with 48.03 GB available.Listing the drive's contents with all folder sizes calculated looks like the following (having used defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE in the Terminal):<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b2JaB.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Adding all that up brings me to a total of less than 350 GB. Running sudo du -sh .DocumentRevisions-V100/ reveals that that folder is only 17 M, contributing very little to the total.So I seem to be missing about 100 GB of space. This isn't an emergency, I'm just trying to figure this out. Why am I seeing a discrepancy between the amount of space reported as available from the Finder and the amount of space I expect there to be given the size of the files and folders I see?

agent
If you don't have view permissions it will report itself as taking zero space to the directory that encloses it. This is especially visible with the "Users" folder. Take another User's folder.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Djfa8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Notice how oddly small this folder appears. Yet it is reporting a valid file size, as I have read permissions to the folder.Now look at the contents of this folder.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yeAEa.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Notice the variety of folder that I don't have view permissions for. As a result, when viewing the overall user folder, it simply assumes they take no space instead of reporting an error of some sort. Thus, the folder size is deceptively small.If you want a more accurate report, I would recommend using something like <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DaisyDisk</a> or a free alternative to scan the entire disk as admin so you can properly see what's taking up space.

user
Interesting idea, but I'm afraid that's not it. My first thought was that there are no other users, which is *mostly* correct. `/Users/` has three folders, `administrator`, `Guest`, and `Shared`. In terminal I `cd`ed into `Guest` and used `sudo` to check the size contents. It's less than 9 MB. But I will try something like DaisyDisk to see if that sheds any light.

agent
@Chuck /Users/ isn't the only folder, I was just using it as an example since it's pretty obvious to see.

user
Well, I've narrowed it down a little bit. It appears to be something in `/Library`. The Finder reports it as about 300 GB, but `sudo find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -mindepth 1 -exec du -hs {} \;` reports it as 384 GB, so it looks like at least most of the space is taken there. I'll keep investigating.

agent
@Chuck I would strongly recommend using a disk scanner, it will be much faster.

user
Well, it looks like you were right. It turns out the missing data was found in `/Library/Server/Caching/Data/`, and the Finder couldn't see it for size calculation because of permissions. Honestly, I don't understand why, as `ls -l` reveals that the permissions for the "administrator" user are `drwxr-x---`, which I *think* means that the current user has full access, but at this point I don't care. Like I said, it wasn't an emergency, just curiosity, and since it's a cache, I can probably delete it without negative effect.BTW, in case anyone is curious, I tracked down the difference by drilling down with the Finder and the Terminal and using `sudo find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -mindepth 1 -exec du -hs {} \;` at each step to see where the difference lay.

Let's say my OS X user's folder is called Attila and I have a folder with the same name in a folder, e.g. ~/Xcode/Attila/. Now, if I do a Time Machine backup, the ~/Xcode/Attila/ folder won't be copied.Why is it? Is there a workaround to fix this?(OS X version: 10.8.3)EDITtmutil removeexclusion doesn't seem to work in this case:EDIT 2Might not be relevant, but my user account was migrated from a Time Machine backup.

I am assuming you have already checked in in System Preferences > Time Machine > Options to ensure those folders have not been excluded?We can then use the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/tmutil.8.html" rel="nofollow">tmutil</a> utility to find out some more information about this.From Terminal enter this command:tmutil isexcluded ~/Xcode/AttilaThis will tell you whether it has been excluded from Time Machine backup or not.

Hmm... Well at least that does help us out. We know that time machine is actively ignoring it (rather than a bug). Try without the -p flag. Also, perhaps it's the Xcode folder that is excluded?

Everything else works fine, too.I don't really need my Recovery HD, because I also got another external recovery partition on an USB Stick. But I would be glad to know about what's the issue here, especially since it makes me feel crumbly to have an encrypted drive which relys on a not correctly installed Recovery HD by using CoreStorage. Running on a correct setup would make me feel a lot better ;)I installed it by the following steps:<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70472/diy-fusion-drive-adding-recovery-hd-to-a-corestorage-volume-group">DIY Fusion Drive: Adding Recovery HD to a CoreStorage Volume Group</a>(First made install on HD to create Recovery HD, then merging Full SSD and HDD partition, recovering backup from CCC)What I also do know is it's important to setup BootCamp prior FileVault. I restored my Windows 7 from a Winclone Image, since that is much more convenient, than installing Windows and all the utilities you need every time. I'm also very sure that this isn't causing the issue.Im using a MacBook Pro 9,1 (mid 2012, non Retina) with a 512 GB Samsung 840 Pro in Optibay using OWC Data Doubler and 1 TB WD Scorpio Blue in Drivebay. I've got 2 SATA III ports, so it seemed better to leave the HD in Drivebay to avoid noise and keep the Sudden Motion Sensor working...Also got a 16 GB RAM upgrade when I got my SSD in March, but I don't think thats important though.So whats the solution for this mess?3 additional questions:Will I be able to boot to Recovery HD using FileVault (assuming it works properly)? If it works after the encryption, I wouldn't make an effort to fix it...Will the second Boot Device which boots OS X which is there because of Fusion Drive usually disappear after encryption ist done?Can Windows booted from a device in optibay (My first setup when I got my SSD was: 2 partitions on SSD, one for the Fusion Drive and one for Windows, to get that fast, too. But I couldn't work it out to boot, it always gave me the "no bootable device" error. Some others have stated though, When installed in the Drivebay, a Windows installation can be put back into optibay after that and works fine: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76821/windows-will-not-boot-to-my-boot-camp-partition-on-a-diy-fusion-drive-gives-n">Windows will not boot to my boot camp partition on a DIY fusion drive - gives &quot;No bootable device found&quot; error</a>)EDIT:bless -info -verbose gives me:Andys-Macbook-Pro:~ Andy$ bless -info -verboseEFI found at IODeviceTree:/efiCurrent EFI boot device string is: '&lt;array&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;IOMatch&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;IOProviderClass&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;IOMedia&lt;/string&gt;&lt;key&gt;IOPropertyMatch&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;UUID&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;2B1B626D-ECA3-45E0-B2C1-F9091B0BE3F4&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;BLLastBSDName&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;disk10s2&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/array&gt;'Boot option is 8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C:Boot0080Processing boot option 'Mac OS X'Boot option matches XML representationCould not find disk device for stringCould not find network interface.Firmware feature mask: 0xC003FF37Firmware features: 0xC001F537Legacy mode suppportedBoot option is not a legacy deviceCould not interpret boot device as either network or diskCan't interpet EFI boot deviceI will try to rename the Recovery HD to "Boot OS X" but I've seen others which have called it recovery HD and it works just fine...

I couldn't see where you list your operating system version. According to this <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5101360" rel="nofollow">ASN thread</a>, 1: you need 10.8.3 or later, and 2. there are still lots of problems reported using Fusion drives. Most everyone recommends using a VM instead.

user
Was using 10.8.5 and now 10.9. Every install etc was done with an up to date install media.What has a Vm to do with a Fusion Drive?! ô0

agent
VM would be MacOS - based. Boot Camp isn't, and there may be driver issues between the drive and Windows. That's speculating, but there are a lot of discussion threads on this issue.

user
The Samsung 840 Pro in general works perfectly fine with Windows, no doubt... Is that what you mean by driver issues?Ok so you're referring to my third question. As I use Windows 7 for Gaming, a VM isn't really an alternative. It seems there are some issues booting windows not from the primary SATA slot (which is the original HD bay, of course). But I also read that some people got it to work to boot Win 7 from an SSD in optibay somehow, but didn't really understand what was the deciding factor. So if someone who did this would be able to clarify that would be great.

I am curious as to what typeface was used on the Mac OS 9 &amp; early Mac OS X boxes. Where it reads "Installing Mac OS 9". The slopes of the letters are slightly different than any font that comes pre-installed on a modern Mac, and the 9 is obviously quite unique looking. If anyone is aware of the typeface name please let me know. Danke. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EH77p.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

agent
The font being used is Apple Garamond. This was used by Apple as one of its corporate fonts since the Mac was first launched in 1984 up until the early 2000s.For more information on this and other typefaces used by Apple, refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography_of_Apple_Inc." rel="nofollow noreferrer">Typography of Apple Inc</a>. 

user
After some research I have discovered claims that this font can be extracted from the Setup Assistant.app on several versions of OS X, though after going through my install disks for 9.1-10.3 I could find no such thing. Are you aware as to whether or not it can actually be obtained from the installer?

agent
I'm aware of those claims, but to be honest I've never actually tried it. I do have all the original macOS install disks going back 25+ years, so I can have a go at it myself, although I wouldn't get a chance until the weekend. There was also an Apple Font Pack (or something like that) which I have somewhere - but I don't recall if Apple Garamond was included or not. Can I ask how you're wanting to use it? That may have an impact on what version you'll need. Also, you can actually download non-official versions of Apple Garamond which are pretty close, if that's of any use to you.

user
I recently purchased a new copy of the OS 9.1 CD (I sold my old one quite a while back, thinking I wouldn't need it.), but it came in a paper sleeve with no box or case. The disc was in perfect condition however, so I want to make a cover for the jewel case I'm keeping it in. I want it to look as authentic as possible for my own peace of mind, as of right now its just sitting in a generic unmarked case, and it's bothering me every time I look at it. A disc this well preserved deserves proper packaging, in my opinion.I've tried several of the unofficial versions already, but the accents and slopes are too different from the original as far as I'm concerned. When you put the two side by side the difference it pretty clear, even if the individual differences are small, there are so many of them that most unofficial versions just look like regular Garamond to me, and those that are closer to Apple's version are so slightly off that it creates an uncanny valley effect, for lack of a better phrase.

agent
No worries. :) What software and version of macOS are you wanting to use the font in?

user
GIMP 2.8, on Sierra

agent
Houston, we have a problem. I spent a couple of hours today scouring through some old macOS install media (from Mac OS 7 up to Mac OS X 10.3) and collected a whole heap of fonts, placed them on a USB flash drive, and then packed everything away (including the old Power Macs I was using). I then plugged the USB into my main Mac and none of the fonts are visible. I then tested the USB on all the Macs I have *easy* access to (ranging from Snow Leopard to Sierra) and none of them can see the fonts. So I'm thinking this isn't going to work for you in Sierra. :(I figure we have three options: (1) Forget the font and instead increase the resolution of the image you have and crop the text out of it for your project; (2) I grab the old Power Mac out of storage and create both a disk image and an archive of the fonts and hope this somehow works on newer systems; or (3) I go digging around for the old Apple Fonts Pack and see if this works on Sierra. Alternatively, if you have another suggestion, I'm all ears. :)

user
I suppose it could work without the text, though I would prefer it look as much like the original box as possible, albeit cropped to fit in a jewel case. I appreciate that you spent that much time looking already, and don't want to ask you to go digging through storage again. Plus I was also unable to see the fonts while browsing my copies of the discs (also on Sierra), so making a disk image likely wont help. You'd think it would be easier to find a picture of the OS 9 cover, but all the image searches I've done have turned up nothing. Perhaps I'll have to use  a 3rd party font.I had found (aside from the picture above) a single straight-on picture of the Mac OS 9 installer box, but like I said I'm making a cover for 9.1, which is why I needed the font.

Suppose you am living outside US &amp; you want to buy iphone like 4s,5, 5s,5c in US.Then How can you check the frequency bands of 3G and 4G LTE carriers (in the place u r living) to make sure they are supported by iPhone 4s, 5, 5s, 5c?So, Each carrier use just 1 band right? or is there any carrier that require your iPhone to suppose 2 bands?also, are there 2 or more carriers that use the same band?Quite confused.

agent
One place would be to look on Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/" rel="nofollow">own page here</a>.There is way too much detail on that page for me to summarise here, but it covers most (all?) countries and carriers where the iPhone is currently available, including those in the US.So find any models that are supported by your current (non-US) carrier, and see whether those models work with any US carriers.

user
but it is still not very clear cos I don't know which specific Band a carrier in charge. For example, regarding 4G LTE, each carrier will have 1 band only or they have many bands

agent
For that, you would need to find out from the carriers. They may tell you on their own website, or you may be able to find out from forums on the internet.Actually, you don't care which band the carrier uses - you only care which models of iPhone support that carrier, and that information is available on the link I included.

user
But a carrier may have many different services. For ex, u r using 4G WiMax in Sprint & iPhone does not support WiMax . However u read somewhere people saying that this iPhone model is supported in Sprint but actually for different network not for WiMax. So it is still very important to know it in details.

agent
I didn't say it was easy! And it's all country- and carrier-specific, so I am afraid you are going to have to do some research ...

user
yes, i am doing research for my company

Following <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/295805/194313">this</a> guide and substituting GeForce for AMD, I've been able to get my mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina functional again, albeit without the advantages of the discrete GPU (background: original GPU failed sometime between 2013 and Oct 2017 but machine continued to function and I had no reason to check for the GPU until Oct of 2017, Apple replaced logic board Jan 23 2018, second GPU failed most likely on last Friday evening and machine refused to boot at all).The only problem, or at least the only one that I'm going to worry about, is that things are running a bit hot. Is there any way through software that I can either power down or throttle the GPU? At least I assume from the information in that guide that it is the GPU causing extra heat due to there not being any drivers loaded to control it.

agent
<a href="https://gfx.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gfxCardStatus</a> is a menu bar app that lets you choose which of the integrated or discrete GPU is active. I believe if you choose 'integrated only' the dedicated GPU won't be used. Just remember to set it each reboot, I haven't found a way to get it to remember settings across shutdowns.

user
I have that app installed, but I haven't noticed things being any cooler. Of course my temperature estimates are purely subjective based on the feel of the case since I haven't been able to find an app that can give me the GPU temp (if that's even possible without the GeForce kext loaded), only the CPU.

agent
@ColinYoung my mac generally runs hotter while running GPU intensive applications with the discrete chip disabled. My (nvidia) GPU doesn't seem to generate any noticeable heat unless I'm doing something GPU intensive, does the AMD chip not behave the same way?

user
I have no idea about the AMD chip. Does Google Chrome count as "GPU intensive"? :) Like I said, it's a subjective heat estimate. I could just be paranoid since I've mucked about with things and potentially disabled the ability to control the power to the chip.

agent
@ColinYoung you might find it helpful (if you haven't already) to locate the GPU and CPU locations and check if the GPU is noticeably warmer than the CPU. At least on my mac, the two are somewhat separated and it's clear when the GPU is producing heat by touch alone.

user
That's a good idea. Unfortunately I've been finding it difficult to find an image that I can be confident is the correct logic board in my machine and allows me to identify the GPU and CPU. At this point it might actually be faster and easier to order a set of pentalobe drivers and just open it up myself...

Since the last update, iTunes is unusable for me on my iMac, because with every song change it shows a "Could not connect to the iTunes Store" error message. My network at work does not allow access to the iTunes store, but that is ok. I just want to listen to my local music connection there.I have disabled the iTunes Store in the parental settings completely, but still, the error pops up with each and every song change. Any idea how to prevent iTunes from showing this popup?There are two major annoyances here in iTunes imhoa) iTunes tries to access the store even if it is disabled completely in the settings and you're signed outb) The error messages "staple" on top of each other, so iTunes diplays the same error 1000 times and you have to click them all away. This reminds me of Windows 95 times.

agent
Here is my solution (sorry for my bad English, I'm French)Delete iTunes in "Applications" folder in finder : "Read Informations" on iTunes App, access read &amp; write permission for everyone, and put iTunes in Trash.Download previous iTunes version : Go to this page : <a href="https://www.downloadbestnow.com/itunes-download/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.downloadbestnow.com/itunes-download/</a> ,scroll down and click on the download link "Download for Mac OS".Open the file downloaded and install iTunes 12.5.3.17Enjoy iTunes &amp; wait for a fix update.:)

user
Well, the big problem with this is that I have to rebuild my iTunes Library as the "old" iTunes cannot open my "new" xml. This means that e.g. all my song rating are GONE. This was only like 50 hours of work to rate all the songs... -.-. Plus, it's _very_ Microsoft to me to just roll back to an elder version because the new version has bugs so big you can neither fix them nor use the software anymore...additionally, downloading software from a (to me) non-trusted source like "downloadbestnow" is completely out of the question

agent
I think more you use iTunes options, more you have problems. Few times ago I understood that I should less options possible if I want really a clean and secure iTunes. So I think you need do some concessions.About the security i understand, but it's the only link i found to download mac version of iTunes in this version.

user
Thanks for the effort. It might be good to some people having this problem - just to me, it doesn't help that much. I have posted a link for an older version of iTunes above directly from Apple, but your version might be good for some who have no problems running from non-trusted sources."I understood that I should less options possible if I want really a clean and secure iTunes" - Actually being able to use the options provided is one of the main reasons I use Apple and pay the premium price... :/

New Mac user here, trying to figure out how to adapt my workflow and the like from Windows/Linux to Mac.I think the answer might be "it's not possible" but here goes anyway.I'm used to leaving documents open as a reminder to complete them later. This means I'm used to quickly glancing at the taskbar (dock) to determine which documents I have open and what I need to do. Since the red x doesn't actually close a lot of apps - terminal for instance - it makes it a little tedious to determine if I have an open document.The only solutions I can think of are either remembering to manually ⌘Q-ing each window (oof), or to right click each open app to determine if there are opened documents and then remembering the answer. Neither of those are great so I'm wondering if anyone has any good methods around this.I realize this might encourage discussion/opinions, but I'd like to emphasize that I am looking for concrete answers EG: "there isn't a way" or "This setting will make the number of opened documents be displayed on the dock". One of the biggest issues I'm having with moving to Mac is determining the best way to solve a problem, and I'm guessing that what I think is a solution here might not actually work.

agent
this are my settings where a black dot are shown in the outer edge of the dock to mark open applications. and all the minimised apps are stored as an icon in the dock itself.I assumed you used document to say app.if it is about one application, multiple windows, open documents can be seen in window menu on the top. OR by sliding down three fingers(app expose; set the gesture in touchpad gestures.) to see if such window is present on other document.however only #2,#5,#6 are relevant.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxMU5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>also,  feel free to ask more such tips as that's what I like to explore on my Mac.

user
Ahh, yes, thanks. I had had #2 checked. I think with app expose and being able to actually see minimized apps I'll be able to work with this. Not the exact same workflow of course, but just as quick.

agent
why do you think #5 wouldn't work? thats what I check before shutting my Mac down, to close all open apps except finder (can't be quit). the dots appear towards the bezel and are white in dark mode o/w black.also, please mark the answer correct! :) @Biggs

user
Oh, it did work. I had #5 checked, but it on it's own wasn't quite enough, I needed to have minimized applications easily viewable when I used app expose. If #2 is checked then the minimized window is only discoverable by right clicking the app.

Every time I connect my iPhone 5S (7.0.3, but have had this issue since 7.0 with both 5S and iPhone 4) to my computer (Latitude E6410 with Windows 7 Pro) I get prompted to Trust the computer. I trust it, and each time I reconnect the USB cable, the prompt returns.I am not alone. Googling this issue, it seems to affect a large number of Windows 7 users. There isn't a single solution that appears to work for everyone, but this one seems to have helped some:<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1567" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1567</a>However, it presupposes the presence of the AMDS service. I do not have this service, I presume because I do not have iTunes installed (and I would prefer not to install it). Nowhere could I find any information from Apple about whether iTunes is required for Trust. So my questions are:(a) is it true the iTunes is required for establishing "Trust"?and (b) if so, is there a workaround?Note: this post (related to Linux) would imply to me that it should work without iTunes:<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/102417/ios7-wont-trust-linux-computer">iOS7 won&#39;t trust linux computer</a>

agent
Definitely yes. You must have iTunes installed in order for the "Trust computer" option to be remembered. What you can do is the following:Temporarily install iTunes, do not run the program itself on your computerConnect the iPhone and tap "Trust"Go to the newly-created Apple Lockdown folder on Win 7 it is found here:C:\ProgramData\Apple\LockdownCopy the whole folder and paste it to a location you can remember (i.e. PC Desktop)<a href="http://www.copytrans.net/support/completely-uninstall-itunes-and-related-apple-software/">Fully uninstall iTunes from your computer</a><a href="http://www.copytrans.net/support/install-iphone-ipod-touch-and-ipad-drivers-without-installing-itunes/">Install the iOS drivers without installing iTunes</a> (these drivers are needed in order for your PC to correctly recognize the iPhoneRestart PC if neededNavigate to:  C:\ProgramData\Add a new folder named "Apple" and inside it paste the "Lockdown" folder along with its contents.This will keep your iPhone trust setting without the need for iTunes being installed

user
Firstly - great post and very useful information - thank you. Regarding "definitely yes" do you know whether Apple have stated this to be the case? On my work machine, this approach is not feasible (though it is for my home machine, so I will try it tonight).Another comment/follow up: I have noticed that the Trust prompt doesn't appear immediately upon connection (generally at least). Is there something Windows is doing to prompt a 'lack of trust'? For example, trying to open the folders for viewing?

agent
Regarding the "Trust" option not appearing immediately, it could be provoked by Plug and Play (once Windows tries to open up the iPhone after connect). Concerning my certitude, there's unfortunately no official Apple document confirming that you must have iTunes installed in order to remember the setting, however, Step 4. here hints that this is most probably the case: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5868.

user
Thank you, I have accepted the answer. It is the best by far :) Would be interesting to approach the problem from the perspective of avoiding "mistrust"...

I tried to install Windows on my Mac Pro but it failed because my disk needed to be repaired; it was suggested that I hold cmd + r during a restart.I tried that but when it restarted I was showed a grayish window that asked for my password. I typed my password but it won't work.I retried several times but it refused my password. I am very sure I hadn't forgotten it because when I restarted normally it accepted my password.Because I needed to install Windows so bad, I opted to transfer my data to another Mac, thus I was advised to restart my Mac in target mode. I did restart in target mode but when it started the grayish login window is presented.Now since it won't accept my password, I basically have a dead computer and I don't know what to do. Any suggestions to get past this window?

From your description, I believe you're looking at the firmware password:This isn't specific for Target Disk Mode, and would have been set through the Firmware Password Utility.This script may be able to decrypt your firmware password, however it doesn't work on all Macs.python -c "print ''.join(chr(int(c, 16) ^ 170) for c in '`sudo nvram security-password`'.split('%')[1:])"Source: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57521667-263/use-the-calculator-to-reveal-a-macs-firmware-password/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CNET</a>

@Kay The firmware password shouldn't protect you from booting into your default OS, so you can do a hard reboot by holding the power button until it turns off, then turn it on normally.

I did force it turn off but whenever I restart it doesn't work. It returns back with the login screenI just talked to apple support. They said I have to bring it to apple store. Since I am not in the us or near any apple store, I guess I have a unusable computer. Yack

I'm attempting to make my USB a bootable windows 7 installation. I have the Windows 7 installation ISO image and related files. When I attempt to format my USB with the files, I receive the error: Boot Camp only supports 64-bit Windows installation on this platform. Please use a ISO file for 64-bit Windows installation.  My ultimate goal is to make the USB bootable with a new Windows 7 install from within my mac, and then booting my old Windows Vista computer with the fresh install.  How might I get this to work? 

agent
Basically, you can use your Mac to create a USB flash drive installer for use on a PC. The steps are given below.<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Install Virtual Box</a>. This is free software.<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Install Virtual Box Extension Pack</a>.

This download website is very slow. Be patient.Put the Windows iso file and the flash drive creation tool on the flash drive.Copy the iso and creation tool from the flash drive to the Windows virtual machine main drive.Use the creation tool to transfer the iso to the flash drive.If you need a better explanation of any step, let me know.Advice on VirtualBox and Flash DrivesTry these steps.Click on the image of a USB flash drive on the bottom of the virtual machine window. Note the devices.Insert the flash drive in a USB port.Repeat step 1. The flash drive is the new item in the list. Usually something cryptic. The item may be grayed out.If the item is grayed out, then you must unmount the flash drive. You can do this from the Disk Utility application, but sometimes this fails to work. If you use the Terminal application, you can enter the command diskutil list before and after inserting the flash drive in the USB port. The added disk is the one that must be unmounted. Here, I will assume this is disk1. The command to unmount the flash drive would then be as shown below.diskutil  unmountdisk  disk1  Note:  Sometimes you have to wait a few seconds before the status of a flash drive changes. For example, you can unmount a flash drive, but the item may remain grayed out in the VirtualBox list for several seconds.Click on the image of a USB flash drive on the bottom of the virtual machine window. Select the flash drive. If it is still grayed out, then you must repeat step 4.  Note: I would not mess with the VM "Ports" settings or USB device filters In fact, I have never figured out what the device filters are for.

user
I've downloaded all the files. I am now running the Windows virtual machine with the very ISO that I intend to use to make the bootable USB.  Meaning, when starting the VM, I've pointed it to the ISO on my USB.  So I followed step 5 and am attempting step 6, but I cannot find any way to access the USB from within the Windows 7 VM--that is what you mean, yeah? To access the USB from the VM and use the creation tool from within?  On the VM's "Ports" settings, I've added all the available USB device filters, but I cannot seem to access them from the VM.I have started the VM using 32-bit and 64-bit ISOs. I ultimately need a 32-bit bootable windows to use on the old computer I am trying to restore.  With the VMs however, when I start the 32-bit ISO, I don't receive any feedback regarding the plugged in USB. When I start the VM with the 64-bit, Windows will try and install the "device driver software". But the "USB Mass Storage Device" will show a "X Failed" and not install.

agent
It does take a lot of practice to access a physical USB flash drive from VirtualBox. I updated my answer.

user
Thank you. Got it to boot to the install window. Although it'll never pass this point and instead return me back to the very first install tab. I believe this is more an issue with my ISO and beyond this question.  Much appreciated, sir.

For the back command, Safari only offers a straight keyboard-only shortcut or the multitouch swipe gesture.For the back command, how can I create a hybrid keyboard+mouse shortcut, like alt-left click? It has to be left click + some one-hand keyboard stroke.I forgot to mention, I am left handed therefore I need key strokes on the left hand side of the keyboard.

agent
To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.In the example below hitting the left alt key once generates one back command in Safari (only). An additional mouse click is not needed.You can use the left option/alt key as usual otherwise.Download, install and open <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/" rel="nofollow">Karabiner</a>Open in the menulet Karabiner -> PreferencesOpen the tab Misc &amp; UninstallHit the button Open private.xmlOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editorEnter the customized keycode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;root&gt;    &lt;item&gt;        &lt;name&gt;Option_L to Option_L&lt;/name&gt;        &lt;appendix&gt;(+ When you type Option_L only without other modifiers, send Command+[ in Safari)&lt;/appendix&gt;        &lt;identifier&gt;remap.altL2altL_backward_nomod&lt;/identifier&gt;        &lt;only&gt;SAFARI&lt;/only&gt;        &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R&lt;/autogen&gt;    &lt;/item&gt;&lt;/root&gt;Save the fileOpen in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences the tab Change KeyHit the ReloadXML buttonEnable the remapping. It should be listed at the beginning.If you want to use the right option/alt key instead of the left one just replace OPTION_L by OPTION_R and altL by altR everywhere in the private.xml file.The above keycode customization is only valid for the en_US input source (and probably en_GB, en_CA etc).If you use e.g the portuguese input source (pt_PT) then you have to choose the proper KeyCodes: to get the [ you have to press alt7. Then the line:&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_Rhas to be changed to:&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::KEY_7, ModifierFlag::OPTION_R | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_RIf you want to add a second custom keycode (hitting left cmd key once generates one forward command) use:&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;root&gt;    &lt;item&gt;        &lt;name&gt;Option_L to Option_L&lt;/name&gt;        &lt;appendix&gt;(+ When you type Option_L only without other modifiers, send Command+[ in Safari)&lt;/appendix&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;remap.altL2altL_backward_nomod&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;only&gt;SAFARI&lt;/only&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::OPTION_L, KeyCode::BRACKET_LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R&lt;/autogen&gt;    &lt;/item&gt;    &lt;item&gt;        &lt;name&gt;Command_L to Command_L&lt;/name&gt;        &lt;appendix&gt;(+ When you type Command_L only without other modifiers, send Command+] in Safari)&lt;/appendix&gt;        &lt;identifier&gt;remap.cmdL2cmdR_forward_nomod&lt;/identifier&gt;        &lt;only&gt;SAFARI&lt;/only&gt;        &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_LAZY_COMMAND_L, KeyCode::BRACKET_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R&lt;/autogen&gt;    &lt;/item&gt;&lt;/root&gt;The special KeyCode VK_LAZY_COMMAND_L instead of COMMAND_L doesn't break the function of cmd_left+Some_key: so you can navigate forward in Safari and print the page with cmd_leftP without going forward once more!

user
I did all like you said, it does not seem to work. I did quit/restart Safari though. If I want to enable "forward" with the command key, should I create a separate xml file?

agent
@pt109 Hmm I tested in OS X Lion 10.7.5. First it was stubborn but then it worked for me. Which keyboard layout do you use? en_us? I will retry it in Mavericks! To add other keycodes you don't have to use a second xml Simply add it below  and .

user
I use el capitan 10.11.2 and a french azerty apple keyboard. I tried to activate an other, for example "change esc to caps lock", this one works!

I'm a new Mac user (macOS Sierra on MacBook pro).Coming from Windows, I used PuTTY as my terminal emulator which was fairly simple but quite useful.I'm looking for a terminal emulation program that copies text to the clipboard upon selection (and not requiring my to hit CommandC), like in PuTTY. Is there such an app?Thank you.Daniel

agent
<a href="http://iterm2.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iTerm2</a> has this functionality.It's actually really easy to use and works exactly like you describe - you select your type and then middle click to paste within iTerm.  iTerm2 has many more features that make it far and away better than PuTTY and the best part is that it's free (as in beer) like PuTTY.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dZXFOm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Above screenshot, I have selected the content of my Guest directory.  No clicks or keyboard shortcuts have been pressed.In the image below, I simply press CommandV and paste it from the clipboard to TextEdit.  This is out of the box functionality - I haven't made any modifications to key combinations within iTerm2.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lt7Hgm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
Hi, it's not quite what it does. when you mark text in iTerm2 it isn't copied to the clipboard (cmd+v won't paste anything). If you middle click it copies & pastes but I'm looking for a solution that doesn't require me to switch between the keyboard and the mouse.

agent
I just tested it and it works exactly as described.

user
You mark something, hit cmd+v and it pastes the marked text?

agent
Yup.  Just did it again and took screen shots.

user
Yep, you are right. don't know how I missed it previously.Thank you!

I need a solution that will work without jailbreaking.On Linux and on OSX, I use ssh on the command-line to open ssh tunnels so I can run client-server applications securely.I need to do the equivalent on ios (run some kind of tunnel in the background, while I run a client application through that tunnel).

agent
This isn't possible under the current iOS App Store rules (and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future). Apps are very limited in what they can do in the background, and keeping the sort of persistent connection that an SSH tunnel requires wouldn't be permitted.Some apps (such as VNC clients) have built-in SSH tunnelling capability to get around this, but if the apps you're using don't include it, the only option (short of jailbreaking) is to use the built-in iOS VPN capability. It doesn't support SSH, <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1288" rel="nofollow">but it does support L2TP/IPSec, PPTP, and some other variants</a>.

user
Forgot to mention, I am not looking to sell my app for the public (on the App Store) - this is an in-house app for personal use.  If it really turns out that this isn't possible under ios, I will prolly switch to Android (pretty sure it's possible there, but I will have to confirm) - I tend to be platform agnostic...

agent
Well, even though your app may not be subject to the App Store rules, any third party app from the store will be. Which means unless you jailbreak, you can't do this *using a third party app*. You could of course use an SSH library in your app to include SSH functionality directly, but how do to that is a programming question, more appropriate for [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

user
+1 for that alternative (ty - I will consider it before moving to Android)... ...I'm beginning to see why some developers don't like developing in this kind of environment.  Also thanks for the VPN hint - setting up a VPN server on Linux may be less work than trying to get a ssh tunnel in ios.

I shot a video with an iPad recently for a school project. My teacher told me the iPad shoots at 30 fps, but opening the video afterwards VLC tells me the frame rate is 29.970030.By watching the video and stepping through the frames, how can I calculate the exact time duration between 2 frames?E.g. what's the time difference between frame 100 and frame 130? Is it 1 second (assuming 30 fps) or slightly more/less?

agent
29.97* is a Standard... an odd standard but a standard nevertheless.It is commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_timecode#Drop_frame_timecode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">drop-frame</a>You can read the entire wikipedia article, but basically it was a kludge to make analog 30fps broadcasts not display odd interference patterning based on the frequency of the picture sub-code &amp; sound sub-code. [You really don't need to know all this ;)The 'drop frame' is really not dropping frames; it's dropping time code so that it doesn't eventually go out of sync.The picture should actually still be running at 30fps, in "real" time.The formula, btw is 30/1.001 - though being a kludge in the first place it doesn't quite work like that...  That is, drop frame TC drops 18/18000 frame numbers, equivalent to  1/1000, achieving 30×0.999 = 29.97 frame/s. This is very slightly  slower than the true NTSC frame rate of 30/1.001 = 29.97002997  frame/s, which is equivalent to dropping 1/1001 frame numbers. The  difference is one additional NTSC frame per 1,000,000 drop frame TC  values, which is negligible.This one you can truly blame the Americans &amp; the NTSC** television standard for - the rest of the world went with a far more sensible 25fps which never needed this workaround.*or more precisely, depending which way you calculate it, 29.97002997**NTSC stands for Never Twice the Same Colour ;-)

user
Do you know how I can calculate the exact time duration between 2 frames?

agent
https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=D%26section=6%26tasks=true 1 Frame = 1/29.97s = 1.001s

user
According to oa- though the frame rate is variable. Is that documentation specifically about iPad footage because from my brief scan it seems to be just general about drop frame recordings.

I have a folder to distribute. On Mac, I can put all the folder's contents into a DMG, which the user can just click to open and see all the contents.What is the equivalent on Windows? Some have said ISO, but when I create one, Windows either sees it as a DVD image and opens Windows Disk Image Burner or sees it as a compressed directory, making the user extract all contained files before they can be used.Isn't there something that can just be opened in the same way as a DMG?

agent
For Windows 7 &amp; earlier, software is available to mount ISOs as though they were mounted CD/DVDs, but it requires the user to already be prepared for this.I've previously used <a href="http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MagicISO</a> quite successfully.This has changed with Windows 10 - you can now either Mount or Burn an ISO From <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-natively-mount-and-burn-iso-images-in-windows-10/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Addictive Tips : How To Natively Mount And Burn ISO Images In Windows 10</a>  To mount a disc image, select the file in Windows Explorer and go to the Manage tab. The Manage tab is always context aware and the controls in it change depending on the selected file type. When you select the ISO file, the Manage tab featuring Disc Image Tools has two options; Mount and Burn.    <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqOBu.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>    If you choose to Mount the file, you can see what’s inside and even execute files in it.  <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOrbl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

I previously had a DLink modem-router (DSL-2740B). I replaced it with a small ADSL D-Link modem and a TimeCapsule.While I'm quite happy with it, the main and only criticism I could make is the loss I had in the Wifi coverage in my apartment.When I had an almost full signal in my bedroom with the DLink, I can now barely connect.I know that an Airport Extreme Base Station would be an option to extend the network but the distance from the TimeCapsule to the bedroom seems quite "normal" to me so that a single wifi emitter would be enough as it was before.I plan anyway to put in my bedroom an Airport Extreme Base station to dispatch my music collection on my hifi system, but I'm afraid it wouldn't even reach the network. Are there any tips and tricks?In Airport Utility, the Transmit Power is already at 100%.Are there any other parameters to check/tweak?EDIT:Here is the screenshot of iStumbler. My network is highlighted.

agent
Run iStumbler from your Mac.  <a href="http://www.istumbler.net/" rel="nofollow">(Get it here)</a>. Look at the other wireless networks in your vicinity - and check what channel(s) they're running on.  You want your device to be as far away from those channels as possible.  There is a 3-channel overlap.  That means, a device on channel 1 will interfere (albeit only slightly,) with a device on channel 3 (or 4?  I forget.)  So if lots of devices are on channel 6 (most come out of the box on this channel,) you want to be on 9/10/11 or 3/2/1.  I almost always just use 1 or 11.There is also a "use network robustness" option which I think increases range but decreases bandwidth.  See <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Airport/5.0/en/ap2072.html" rel="nofollow">this Apple Article.</a>

user
Tried iStumbler. I see my network twice (once with 2,4Mhz and one with 5,5Mhz). First signal is 76% and second 58%. My MBP is 10cm from my capsule. I'm using channel 1 while all other networks in the vicinity are using channel 11. Noise is 13% (added the screenshot to my initial post). The advanced options in the Airport configuration are "Multicast Rate" which is on "Low" and "Use Wide channels" which is activated.

agent
LudoMC: that is very normal.  Walk away from it slowly and see how rapidly the signal drops off.  I still think interference is the problem here - it may be sitting next to (or under, or on top-of) something emitting a strong signal.  Take particular note when you put a wall between yourself and the device, and see what the change is.  If one wall in particular affects your signal more than the others, perhaps there are cables or even a device in the wall having a detrimental effect.  (Yes, I've found devices in walls using this method.)

user
I upvoted earlier to thank you for pointing me out to iStumbler. Anyway, is there a way to improve the signal, from Airport tool or the way the capsule is placed? I keep thinking it's strange that at 10cm from the Mac the signal is only 78%. Could it be a faulty device as suggested by CajunLuke?

agent
@LudoMC - actually this is normal.  I almost never see a noise reading that isn't 13%, and I've never seen a signal strength of 100% (or even 90%+) with an Airport.  I think because iStumbler represents the data in a way which we don't necessarily understand because we're not wireless engineers.

user
Clear I'm no network engineer...! Just sad the capsule doesn't perform better. Probably linked also to the inner antennas; design has a price. I accept your answer till I get the magic one which will put my capsule to 200% signal :)

Thanx for the effort Daniel, all I can do is vote you up since I don't have this issue any more since the 2 complete reformats. However, now, i get a minute of black screen after every other system wakeup. The irony. :}

agent
Does your initial problem and this new "black screen" happen on battery?

user
Both. On battery and off battery.

A couple of years ago I bought a used macbook pro from a friend of mine, I knew it was a good deal cause the mbp was modified and had very good response and performance, the specs of this mbp are the following (although its in spanish you will get it):<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkO5R.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vO2To.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3QyqX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>I love this macbook, firstly cause its 15 inch and I prefer big laptops, secondly cause the performance its good, from a normal web and email browsing session, up to a large xcode programming workspace or a whole 30 min final cut pro video edition.In the other hand I recently bought a band new 21.5 inch iMac which also seemed like a good deal, my logic in that moment was that if my 2009 second-hand mbp (2.8 GHz core duo) had excellent performance, a 2014 retina iMac (3GHz Intel core i5) would be up to three times faster than my laptop. iMac specs:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ei7Nr.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uP8vi.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BLfqZ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>This iMac its always laggy and opening any app takes soooo much time. It constantly freezes and I cant think about having more than 3 apps at the same time, that would be useless.I dont know exactly what customization the MBP had, guess it was a RAM and video card upgrade next to the 250GB SSD. My question is, whats the problem with the iMac and what can I do to achieve the same (or better) performance that the mbp?The SSD is the main difference?

agent
Yes, the SSD is the main difference.Your iMac has a 1TB 5400rpm SATA Hard Drive and this is what’s causing the bottleneck. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, has a solid state drive that is multiple times faster. So, while the iMac may actually process things faster, loading apps and reading/writing data will be a lot slower. And, if it needs to use hard drive space when it needs more RAM, this will also significantly slow things down.Achieving the same/better performanceSince your iMac has two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports that support speeds up to 40 Gbps (via Thunderbolt) and 10 Gbps (via USB 3.1 Gen 2), the easiest solution is to use an external SSD that’s connected via one of these ports and to install macOS instead. You would then use that drive as your main boot volume. However, you would need to ensure that:it’s definitely an external SSD (and not just a hard drive)it supports either Thunderbolt or USB-C (i.e. USB 3.1) as its interfaceBoth of the above are critical if you’re wanting to improve speed. Thunderbolt models are still quite expensive, but you'll find USB-C / USB 3.1 models at reasonable prices.NOTE:  Do not get confused by USB 3 - this is not the same as USB 3.1. And remember, it needs to connect to one of the two Thunderbolt ports (not one of the USB ports).Some examples of the types of external drives I mean are:<a href="http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/t5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Samsung T5</a><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKRA2ZM/A/sandisk-480gb-extreme-510-usb-usb-c-portable-ssd?fnode=5f" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SanDisk Extreme 510</a><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HLRB2VC/A/g-technology-1tb-g-drive-mobile-ssd-r-series-storage?fnode=5f" rel="nofollow noreferrer">G-Technology G-DRIVE mobile SSD</a>Once you have the drive you want, you will need to install macOS onto it and migrate your data. 

user
Amazing tip. I wanted to confirm my SSD theory and you did. Also, the idea of an external drive sounds pretty good cause I was thinking about taking this issue to the apple technical support so they sell me the HDD to SSD migration, but definitely the external its a much practical solution.

agent
The other good things about this approach is you don’t necessarily need to buy a 1TB external SSD, as the main thing is that you have enough space for your macOS installation and all your apps. Another advantage (and what I would do) is use the internal hard drive as storage. So, for example, you can use the internal drive for your big storage items such as your Photos and/or iTunes libraries as they typically take up quite a bit of space. This will still be quicker than what you have now because the system isn't reading/writing from the same drive.Hi Karlo, just wondering if you've had a chance to get your hands on an appropriate external SSD yet? If you have any questions just comment below. :)

user
Thanks for the follow up, I checked some drives but unfortunately I cant afford one now. When I buy it I sure tell you If there was a change.I bought a 128GB SSD with 450 mb per second speed average and an external hard drive enclousure with USB C type 2, with capacity up to 10gbps transfers. What do you think? Will that work???

agent
That should do fine. :) Let me know how you go! :)

I'm using a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid-2014) running El Capitan. I'm trying to create a script that checks if my computer is open or not, and I'm using this:ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState | grep '"AppleClamshellState"' | cut -f2 -d"=""I tested this in Terminal and it works fine, so I add do shell script in front of it to run it in AppleScript. But when I do, it gives me this:Expected end of line, etc. but found identifier.Please help!

agent
Instead of piping to grep and cut, just use awk.do shell script "ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState | awk -F \" = \" '/AppleClamshellState/ {print $2}'"-F \" = \" makes the separator: = (space = space)/AppleClamshellState/ Search for: AppleClamshellState{print $2} Prints Yes or No depending on what's returned for:AppleClamshellStateE.g "AppleClamshellState" = No prints No<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dEQ7w.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>You can also use:do shell script "ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState | grep 'AppleClamshellState' | cut -d'=' -f2"However there will be a leading space in front of Yes or No as cut only handles a single character for the deliminator.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HKN8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Note: The command text portion of do shell script, e.g. do shell script "uptime" must be double-quoted. So when the command text string itself is using double-quotes within the string, one should substitute a single-quote ' wherever possible and if double-quotes must be used within the string then escape them with a backslash \.

user
I get the same error.

agent
Works fine for me!

user
OK, now I have `set myVar to "do shell script "ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState | awk -F \" = \" '/AppleClamshellState/ {print $2}'""`, and it gives me `A identifier can’t go after this “"”.` higlighting `ioreg`.

agent
Your command is malformed! There should be no `"` in front of `do` and you have an extra `"` at the end.  Copy and paste my code exactly as is and it should work!

user
Just realised that right before you commented. Thanks for your help! :-)

I have the system pref "Automatically illuminate the keyboard in low light" disabled. However, when I wake the computer from sleep and the login prompt appears, the keyboard backlight turns on. Despite the fact that I didn't ask for this, it's actually somewhat useful, so I don't object to that. But, once I log in, the keyboard backlight stays on. AND, to make matters worse, the machine seems to "think" that the backlight is off, because pushing the backlight dimming button (the one shared with F5) doesn't dim the keyboard backlight. Instead, I have to first increase the backlight, then decrease it, in order to disable it.So, I'm looking for a way either to: 1. ensure that the auto-enabled keyboard backlight self-disables upon login, or 2. completely, 100%, totally disable any auto-enabling of the keyboard backlight (an acceptable alternative to 1, since I don't really need it auto-enabling at login).Note: an unacceptable solution is one that completely disables the keyboard backlight. I need to be able to invoke it manually when desired.

agent
<a href="http://labtick.proculo.de/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lab Tick</a> is a shareware menu item that gives you complete control over the keyboard backlight. You can set the level of illumination by hand, and electively disable automatic adjustments made by the OS.

user
Slightly odd behavior in that it (I think it) seemed to make my keyboard flicker when I logged in from sleep, until I did the same increase-decrease backlight trick. For some reason Lion seems INTENT on turning my **** backlight on whenever I log in. :(Behavior repeated. Your software seems to be a good idea, but there seems to be some sort of bug or problem ("feature"?) in my install of Lion. Thanks anyway.

agent
Works fine here. Don't know what to tell you.

user
It was a good thought; I think I'll need to wait until someone with a similar problem finds an actual workaround / finds out how to dig deep and disallow the system itself from turning the keyboard-backlight on without direct instruction from the turn-keyboard-backlight-on button :)Maybe if more people can confirm that this worked for them, I'll accept the answer. Since it didn't work for me I have no basis of judging.

How can I keep my whole music library on my NAS and comfortably access it and manage it there and at the same time have a music selection locally stored on my MacBook that I can manage while away and that gets synchronized with my NAS library when I get back.Is there way to do that?My Setup: a Synology DS412+ with DSM 4.1 and a MacBook Pro with Mountain LionUpdate:The idea is to have a master library on the nas and a slave library for mobile use that merges all changes back to the master and gets updated information from the nas. Like a selective cloud sync.Update (2): The purpose of this usage is to be able to play music without having access to broadband internet (train, plane, car, public places, ...) without maintaining two libraries. 

agent
Create two libraries in iTunes, one for your NAS and the local one, then hold down the Option key ⌥ each time you start iTunes to choose a library?Update:Concerning the synchronization, I don't see a compelling automatic solution but can be achieved using rsync.Here's what I came up with :create a playlist from your master (NAS) library containing the tracks you want to store locallyexport the playlist to m3u formatyou want to store the files on your disk using the same folder hierarchy than the NAS to ease later sync. Type in your terminal :  cpio -pd local_iTunes_dir &lt; m3u_file  open iTunes picking your local library, and drag&amp;drop local_iTunes_dir on iTunes dock icon to import files   use rsync to sync edited+new files back to the NAS    See <a href="http://tunecrux.com/exporting-music-from-itunes-mac-while-keeping" rel="nofollow">http://tunecrux.com/exporting-music-from-itunes-mac-while-keeping</a> for details of the technique.More general thought regarding NAS usage:It kinda defeat the purpose of a NAS if you have to maintain a local library. Imo, having the NAS always connected and an internet connection at disposal to access it when you're away, are the 2 constraints to satisfy to take advantage of a such device.

user
but how will information get synced between those libraries? this is the solution I'm using now and that I'm unhappy with.

agent
can you be more specific about the info you want synced ? is it just id3 tags or iTunes related like ratings or playcounts?

user
preferably every but mostly tags and new songs. The idea is to have a master library on the nas and a slave library for mobile use that merges all changes back to the master and gets updated information from the nas. Like a selective cloud sync. _(added this to question body)_The purpose of this usage is to be able to play music without having access to broadband internet (train, plane, car, public places, ...) without maintaining two libraries. The issue would not occur when we would be talking about a desktop computer.

agent
Just to be sure: you don't have an iOS device? because an iTunes synchronisation would work a treat

I just run into a strange issue. My iPhone 6 Plus 64GB (updated today to 9.1 beta 3) started eating my wifi downstream (not upstream) after I plugged it to my macbook for charging. I tried disabling any feature (I was aware of) that could download stuff in the background. Every app is updated on my device. There is also no indicator at the statusbar. Every app is terminated. When I unplug the device from charging and reenable the wifi connection the download process starts again. Rebooting the device while unplugged does help but if I start charging the device it happens again.Any suggestion what that could be, maybe I missed something here. The free space is gone from 6GB down to 3GB already.Version: 9.1 (13B5130b)UPDATE: Version: 9.1 (13B136) behaves the same. I deleted almost all apps I don't use atm and searched trough every setting that could use background downloading. The device is downloading non stop (it should be 4-6GB already).

agent
I would do three things to narrow down the culprit:Connect to Xcode and look at the console logs for the phone - activity might be loggedConnect to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/AnalysisTools/Reference/Instruments_User_Reference/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Instruments and profile the network activity</a>Connect to iTunes and make snapshots of the storage sizes (or use storage and usage on iOS) to see what bins are growing over time.You can turn off iCloud to reduce many downloads, but it really depends on which apps you have installed, how they background data load and what data stores they are configured to pull. Since you are on the betas, you have many options to pick apart the data flow using diagnostic profiles provided by Apple and the developer tools similarly provided.

user
I'll try to profile the network activity as soon as I update to the latest Xcode beta. About the apps: none of them seems to grow at all. So strange.

agent
@DevAndArtist I agree it's strange. I doubt it's app thinning, but that has been slightly problematic as the tooling is changing, the code singing is getting worked out and even your local Xcode can be pushing updates to your device using App Thinning. It's like debugging "enterprise software" all on your own Xcode/iOS fiefdom.

user
Downloading the latest Xcode right now. One thing I just noticed is that my iPhone redownloaded deleted apps. Also the AppStore app tries to indicated these apps with the (updates available) badge, but inside the update section of the store app there is no new updates available. Gosh this is so annoying. The device already downloaded up to 5-6 gigs behind the scenes.

agent
Looks like your iTunes installation is screwed up.Follow <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=4045" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> to uninstall iTunes, it involveskilling it using Activity MonitorMoving it to the TrashMoving the related plist to the Trash.Rebooting.Then go <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" rel="nofollow">there</a> to download the latest version and install it.Once you have done that, see if it's still behaving. Then can (should) update to 10.7.2.

user
maybe this solution solve my problem, but I am not comfortable with uninstalling my iTunes :( I have large library of musics and my iTunes save many info about them like what rate I put on them or how many times I listen specific music. When I uninstall my iTunes and install new one I lost all of these MetaData :(

agent
No, you don't. All that information is stored inside your Music/iTunes in your home folder. I have migrated my iTunes library many times and never had issues.

Running macOS 10.14.2. Safari 12.0.1.Symptoms:Safari redirects searches through proxy to bingChrome redirects searches through proxy to bingIn Privacy Settings, under Automation "Finder" with no icon has access to SafariWhen removing it, a preferences pop up shows up.Immediately after a memory warning shows up and cancel the preferences pop up."Finder" reappears under "Automation" with safari checked.When quitting Safari, it launches alone. (Can't close safari)Attempts:Used "tccutil reset AppleEvents", both pop ups appear once after execution.Used Avira anti-virus with quick scan it found and eliminated 1 virus, ran a full scan and it found and removed 4. Did not run it again.No clue how to remove this without disabling SIP which is not something I necessarily want to do, nor would I know how to exactly find "Finder". It also seems to be using some exploit to grant itself Automation privileges even after you uncheck them via some memory issue that triggers the memory warning. How can malware like this be cleaned?

agent
I wouldn't disable SIP if you have active malware on your system. If you have another Mac you can use or borrow, I'd boot your Mac into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Target Disk Mode</a>, connect it to the other Mac with a Thunderbolt cable, and then run both Avira and Malwarebytes on it from the other Mac. This allows the antimalware software to ignore any SIP protection on the TDM'd Mac and perform a full clean.If you can't use another Mac, then install a bootable copy of macOS onto an external drive, boot from that, and do the same.If you can't do either, boot into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Safe Mode</a>, run Avira, and then if it finds something, let it clean it and then reboot again into Safe Mode. Now run Malwarebytes and do the same. Always reboot after a pass where it found something, because whatever it is that it found may be preventing you from finding anything further until you reboot with it gone.

user
After every pass Avira finds a different number of viruses. Never 0.

agent
Are you attempting cleanup while booted from the infected filesystem, or using another option I mentioned earlier?

user
Safe Mode option. However I ended up switching to malware bytes and it worked.

I'm on 10.9 and @jstrom's solution didn't work for me. For me, the DISPLAY variable was already being set. The problem was a missing ssh-askpass program:[q@haywire/0 ~] ls /usr/libexec/ssh-askpassls: /usr/libexec/ssh-askpass: No such file or directoryecho $SSH_ASKPASS(no output)You can fix this by using a custom ssh-askpass program such as <a href="https://github.com/jcs/openssh-mac/blob/master/cocoa-ssh-askpass" rel="nofollow">jcs's</a> (requires CocoaDialog) or <a href="https://github.com/markcarver/mac-ssh-askpass" rel="nofollow">markcarver's</a>.I prefer to copy this program to ~/bin/ssh-askpass. This requires specifying this location in the SSH_ASKPASS variable; add this to your ~/.bash_profile:export SSH_ASKPASS=~/bin/ssh-askpassYou may also need to make this variable available in launchd context:launchctl setenv SSH_ASKPASS $SSH_ASKPASSBefore it works, you'll need to restart or at least kill and restart the ssh-agent:killall ssh-agentssh-add -c -t 1h

Firstly, I have been using iPad for a few days and this things may be very nooby for you. But funny, I cannot find similar info on Apple forum. Namely, look at this image. This is how my Music app looks like when I open it. I was offered to download iTunes U app, which I did, but I cannot seem to find music in it, only video lectures. Next I tried going to AppStore app to Music section, but there I found only apps. Is this app maybe limited to some countries so I cannot use it? If not, what noobish mistake I have been doing?EDITThere is iTunes Store app on my iPad but it looks weird. all I have is a link to use iTunes U. Check itI searched for the term "music" but it lists podcasts from iTunes U app only. 

agent
The iTunes Store is separate from the App Store - it should have its own iconthis is from an iPhone but they should look similar…As you discovered, iTunesU is for education - see <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/</a>

yes, but only because I put music in there ;) Forget iTunesU, that's for other things entirely, only the pink/purple iTunes Store is what you need to get music

I'd bought MS Office which was allowed to use on 3 Mac OSX with same product key. It was/is working fine when I'd installed it on 1st Macbook Pro.

agent
Activate by phoneI encountered a similar problem in Office 2007 for Windows.Even though I had uninstalled MS Office from another workstation, I was not allowed to use the same licence on a fresh install of Windows 7 Professional.I ended up calling Microsoft support via telephone. They then activated my licence without much hassle.See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2391941" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2391941</a> for more information on how to activate your licence by phone.Also see this question on <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macstart/bought-new-mac-and-want-to-transfer-my-mac-office/2c7535ec-0cc5-44ef-a210-a2b787a07331?msgId=257dbe7a-8df9-470f-bd2d-cb882b29cd51" rel="nofollow">answers.microsoft.com</a>.

user
But question is that, other product of Microsoft are working like MS Word, PowerPoint and Excel are working fine. Why there is issue with MS Office only? If there will be issue of Product Key then none will run.

agent
@Machine Good point. I know via my firewall that *each* application of MS Office connects with registration servers of Microsoft. This may be related to the problem.

user
If *each* application of MS OFfice is connected through server of Microsoft then none should work, why is the issue with Office only.Now what next? Should I email them or what?

agent
@Machine Maybe only Office completed the registration on the previous install (e.g. other applications weren't opened)? I don't know. Anyway, I wish you good luck in getting a useful answer.

user
Thank you for giving your precious time.Anyway, I am having iMail and Thunderbird both are configured. I want Office too for configuring my other email.Is there any other way of configuring two emails with iMail or Thunderbird?

@Machine You can setup multiple accounts of different providers in Mail, Thunderbird and MS Office. But I'd clearly recommend Mail from Apple as it's the easiest to use without loosing much functionality in comparison to the other two clients.

There is a folder called Documents (and other folders beside that) in iFileI tried but can't find the physical location with iFunbox or iTools.How can I find the physical location of that folder?

agent
When using a system that doesn't know how to follow POSIX <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link" rel="nofollow">symbolic links</a> (like iFunbox), then you're going to need to know the actual location of the directory. When using iFile, it'll appear to be located at /var/mobile/Documents/, but in reality, /var is a symbolic link to /private/var/. So the answer to your question is: The Documents folder is located at /private/var/mobile/Documents/.

user
Thanks for Answer But I can't find '/' folder in iFunbox. there is a category called 'Raw File System' and can't see anything relative in that !

I'll have to look in to it further. I haven't used iFunbox in a while.

I used to be able to just quicklook files and copy the text directly from there, removing the need to launch applications to open it which is just awesome, however, it doesn't seem to work since El Capitan. I have tried running the terminal command (defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE) that enables it but it didn't work.What options exist to customize quick look or replace the default plug in with one that allows text selection?

agent
  It's not that the defaults write command fails. I verified the file,  and it wrote the variable to it. The problem is somewhere in the  design. Maybe they have moved it? I have been looking in the  containers and other files but no luck yet. I hope they didn't  completely kill it. Maybe there is a way to copy the old Yosemite  version of QL back? If I figure it out, I will update here.  <a href="https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7250702">https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7250702</a>TRUE - YES or 1 have the same effect, so, there is no problem on this side.The option is no longer available on Onyx or TinkerTools too :<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W16Bm.png"></a>Conclusion :Actually there is no solution to get back the text edit feature on Quick Look.Following this <a href="https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7250702">Apple Thread</a> is the last way to keep hope

user
This sucks. It was one of the best features of Mac OS X. Why would they remove it?

agent
I think the problem is somewhere in the design (click and move the window is in conflict with the text selection)... Perhaps the feature will be back in the next EC update ^^

user
I understand that design problem, but it's not on on default, most users won't bother with Terminal commands like that so it shouldn't be a problem. I hope it comes back too, if it doesn't I hope someone makes a plugin.

While browsing on Safari and listening to iTunes I come across a video and then press the "play" button on the keyboard (to stop the music while I watch the video) it starts/stops the video instead of the music (I have no control over the music).How can I quickly play/pause my music without affecting the video?

agent
You could just add the iTunes or (since High Sierra) Now Playing widgets to notifications centre:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERrQs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>On a MacBook at least this becomes even easier because the notification centre is just a two-finger swipe away.In fact, there's even a keyboard shortcut you can set to open up the notifications centre:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lY2Q1.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
nice suggestion! do you find this to be easier than app switcher + key board shortcut?

agent
I don't really use iTunes that much to be completely honest. If I was having the same problem as you I'd fix it with Karabiner-Elements, which has become my go-to for these kinds of problems. But yes, this is clearly easier than app switcher + keyboard, because ⌘tab won't always go straight to iTunes and you can keep "focus" on whatever app you're currently using instead of having to switch back and forth between different apps.

user
I'm used to navigating my apps using cmd-tab so  and prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard when possible (vs. mouse). I still think this will take more time as I would have to mouse over to the pause button, right? Couldn't find another way to pause. Also I typically keep the Notification Center open to notifications vs. "today"

I want to create a service using Automator to run a shell script on all files in a folder, say delete all log files. What I have done is Created a new service in automator.Added a "Run Shell Script" action. I have change this to 'pwd' for now. Selected "Service receives selected folders".Tried to run it, but get a message. "To test this service within Automator, add the "Get Specified Finder Items" action to the beginning of your workflow. Remove or disable the action before running the workflow outside of Automator.OK. So I add "Get Specified Finder Items". Added a 'test' directory to the list of items.Now, when I run the script, the results window prints out my home directory.Elsewhere, I have read that I maybe need to add cd "$1"to the beginning of my script. I did that but it still prints my home directory. How do I get this thing to print the directory I have selected in "Get Specified Finder Items?"Edited to AddHere is a screen shot of a script that works.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cop5V.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Here is a screen shot os a script that doesn't work. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4yZKc.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>The usual way I would deal with the "no match found : *.log" error would be to redirect error output to null. Replacing the "rm" line byfind . -name "*.log" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rfDoes work though. This seems more difficult than it should be.

agent
If you're creating a Service using RunShell Script which you want to pass the selected Folder(s) to the RunShell Script and have additional actions take place in the script on them, then start with these settings.Create the Service:Open Automator and select Service or File > New > Service If Automator is already open.Set Service receives selected to folders and in to Finder.Add a Run Shell Script Action, setting Shell: to /bin/bash and Pass input: to as arguments.  This changes the default code to from cat to:for f in "$@"do    echo "$f"doneNow you can use $f to act on the target Folder(s), e.g. cd $f and now you're in the directory of $f and can add additional code to act upon the files/folders within $f, etc.Update:Use the following working code as an example:for d in "$@"; do    cd "$d"    for f in *.log; do            rm "$f"    donedoneWithin the Test and Test copy folders there were a number of .log files and files with other extensions as well.  When the above code was run it deleted only the *.log files within the target folders as show in the images below using two folders or one folder and both files and folders with/without spaces in their names.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EVis3.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Wjj.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
Thanks. That works. The bit I was missing was "Pass input: as arguments". However, when I add the lines cd $1, rm *.log 2>/dev/null fails with an error "Run Shell Script failed - 1 error" and nothing more enlightening.

agent
@pheon, Trying to troubleshoot someone's _code_ without a proper [mcve](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) is difficult. Also when using a Run Shell Script, there should be no need to use redirects like `2>/dev/null`. If you're trying to `cd` to the Folder passed to the Automator Service you should be using the `for` loop and `cd $f`` as I said, not `cd $1`. Read the mcve and add additional information to your question so as to enable proper troubleshooting, otherwise there is not much I can do.  You also need to add a screenshot of _code_ being used as it's written in your Automator service.

user
This fails for me if there are no .log files in the folder.

agent
@pheon. Please understand that _code_ provided is example/sample _code_ and is often minimal to show that something can work.  The onus is on the _user_ to write appropriate error checking _code_ and implement it. I'll look at it sometime this weekend and modify/add error checking to the existing example/sample _code_ .

user
I appreciate that it is more complicated than I first thought. I admit I thought it was going to be easy. I was using this as an exercise in learning automator. The frustrating thing is that a bash shell script that works from the terminal does not translate directly into automator and automator does not give useful diagnostic messages when that script fails. Thanks for your help. From here, it is only necessary to help solve the problem if you enjoy the puzzle; I'll find a work around by using the bash script as intended.

Totally normal if on the low side. If your CPU is less than 15% idle, I expect you to get to 85 C internal for CPU proximity and higher for all the on die thermocouples. Running just unde 100 C is how the silicon is designed to operate at max thermal generation and high sustained load. Also, if you use the command line tool to check temperatures or thermal load once every 15 minutes instead of having graphs checking every second you may find your CPU runs much cooler. After all, having those graphs update live in real time prevents the CPU from sleeping.  pmset -g thermlogLots of people are surprised or at least concerned by temps:<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141353/are-these-temperatures-alright">Are these temperatures alright?</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/235788/cpu-die-temperatures-reaches-90-c-is-that-normal">CPU Die temperatures reaches 90&#176; C, is that normal?</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/305011/is-it-normal-for-a-27-imac-to-have-cpu-core-temperatures-around-95c-under-100">Is it normal for a 27&quot; iMac to have CPU core temperatures around 95C under 100% CPU load?</a><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155439/retina-macbook-pro-running-very-hot">Retina MacBook Pro running very hot?</a>From an engineering standpoint, the MacBook Pro and the iMac in the Mac Pro and iMac Pro all have the same power envelope design and push their CPU to 100 C when the work is available.  Once the CPU is at Max normal operating load then the kernel task begins to idle potential work so as not to exceed the final design for the processor.

When at 96% idling, it runs at 40°C give or take 3 degrees.So I should disable/uninstall iStats and run the command line you wrote once every few minutes to check on the temperatures ?Thanks for the links!

I like to use energy use in activity monitor and the thermlog for normal routing monitoring. Turning off all the menu bar, all animation, turning off all graphing let’s my battery lowest consumption. 40 C for 30 W of power seems perfectly normal. Your skin and ambient airflow seem high. Is there air to circulate under the MacBook and are you less than 24C room temperature?

user
I just uninstalled iStat, hopefully it'll do good. How do you check your energy consumption ? Running the command you provided in the Terminal didn't output a temperature, just a list of 3 settings ( available CPUs, scheduler limit and speed limit ), is it normal or should I run this line in a different terminal ? Yep, I mean there's a keyboard an inch behind my MacBook ( I have this laptop and a Windows PC behind it ), but yeah the MBP is put on a flat desktop. My room must be 1 or 2 degrees above 24°C since there's my main computer running

I want to be able to mirror an iPad Air and a late-2016 MacBook Pro to an HDTV. Not simultaneously, just one at a time. I know I could just get both the lightning to digital av adapter and the usb-c (thunderbolt 3) to digital av adapter, but is there a way to do it where I wouldnt need both? Like maybe a female usb-c to male lightning adapter (but it would need to be able to pass both video and audio).If it helps reduce the amount of stuff I'd need to purchase, I already have HDMI to HDMI, HDMI to mini HDMI, and HDMI to mini DP (thunderbolt 2).

agent
Do you happen to have an Apple TV?If so, that would be how I'd do it, using Airplay.If not, then any Apple TV (2nd generation and above) supports Airplay and you already have the cable (i.e. HDMI to HDMI) that you need to connect it to your HDTV.The advantage of this is that you also get all the benefits of having the Apple TV as well, not to mention the fact you won't have your iPad or MBP tethered with a cable (or cables) to your HDTV (i.e. the mirroring happens via WiFi and you're able to have the iPad or MBP anywhere you want while mirroring).If your question is about connecting these devices to any HDTV that you may need to connect to (i.e. not a single one at your home, but to various models in various locations) or you do not want/need an Apple TV, then I'm not aware of a single solution that will pass both video and audio from both devices, but perhaps someone else will have a solution.[EDIT]Just checked and Apple are selling <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/FD199LL/A/refurbished-apple-tv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">refurbished</a> 3rd generation Apple TVs for $59. At that price, it'd be hard to warrant spending the money on cables and/or adaptors, unless you intend to carry them with you in your travels.You can also buy brand new Apple TV 3 units from places like <a href="http://www.target.com/p/apple-tv-black-md199ll-a/-/A-14051076" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Target</a> who still have them in stock (since they've been superseded).

user
I dont have an Apple TV. Interesting to know it can do that, but for now trying to keep the cost down. Looks like Apple TV 3rd gen is ~$70. I guess that is better than 2 separate digital av adapters.It doesnt have to be a "single solution". Was thinking maybe I could get something capable of doing the usb-c to hdmi connection for the macbook, then a simpler adapter of usb-c to lightning to hook on to that for when I want it for use with the ipad (or vice versa). Just wasnt sure about what to look for to make sure the full a/v signal gets adapted and not just for supplying power.

agent
If I happen to come across anything I'll post back. In the meantime, came across some Apple TV 3 units still available at prices that _may_ interest you. I've updated my answer with links.

user
Looks like I'll be going the Apple TV route—Walmart has refurbished 3rd gens for $40. Thanks for the help.

I found several long lists with defaults, settings, but never a complete one with a reference to developers.apple.com. Is there any such list to find? If not, which is the longest/systematic/complete list with defaults?Update:I'm interested more in the system administration point of view on the collection of the defaults settings, rather than in the developing an applicationUpdate2:Interesting could be something like TinkerTool collection in the form of Application, but using only the terminalUpdate3:e.g. all defaults keys from NSGlobalDomain

Well, it was a good exercise for me as well. I have use for a compilation such as this. I think O'Reilly should adapt a Pocket Reference on this subject. (I'd write one myself if I had the time.)

Read this line in iPhone 2G specification <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_2G" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_2G</a>Built-in rechargeable Li-ion battery 3.7 V 1400 mAhSo, "Built-in battery" means "battery is not user-replacable"?Is that true?Or, "built-in" means "hard-welded" (ie fixed forever)&amp; "not user-replacable" means "user can replace if using special tool but Apple does not encourage user to do that"

agent
I presume you mean the original iPhone, and the 2G is referring to the antenna capabilities, rather than the 2nd Generation iPhone (which was the 3G.... yeah, confusing)?Either way, all iPhones have a built in battery.  The wording is there to suggest that it is not user replaceable via a simple swap in/out method by removing a panel or similar user appropriate action that does not require disassembly.  The iPhone 5 still uses broadly similar language "<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/specs/" rel="nofollow">Built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery</a>". You can swap it out, but it's not a simple job.  Just like cars have a built in engine, you can get that sucker out, but you need the tools, parts and skills for the job.  If I recall, there is a lot og glue involved in earlier iPhone models.  And sticky tape.  It's not just a case of unscrewing some stuff and swapping.  But even then, the glue can be removed, the tape replaced etc etc.  The phrasing user-replaceable or more commonly user-serviceable often means it's a supported solution, and there is no way that taking any iPhone to bits is covered under warranty.So, in short, built in means it's not meant to be removed, but that doesn't mean you cannot do it if you tried hard enough.

user
iphone 2G = iphone 1st generation; iPhone 3G=iPhone 2nd generationso "built-in" does not mean "hard-welded" forever? it mean if the battery got malfunctioned then we have to throw away the phone? in iPhone 3G they say "not user-replaceable", they did not say "built-in"

agent
The original battery is has its contacts soldered, then covered in glue, and further more it is stuck to the internals with adhesive tape.  That's pretty built in.  But clearly, you *can* remove it and replace it, if you have the skills. Later phones used more friendly clamp based connections without the glue and solder, but were still taped in and still required full disassembly of almost every part of the phone to get to them.  Marginally easier in total, removing the skill with a soldering iron required, but still what I would call built in.  Non user-replaceable is just a cover term.

user
so, "built-in" is harder to take it out than "not user-replaceable". In the "not user-replaceable", there is no glue & adhesive tape, but in "built-in" case it has glue & adhesive tape & thus it harder to take it out.

agent
In this instance, but those terms really are just interchangeable stuff for *You are not allowed to mes with this if you want your warranty intact*  The wording may have flip flopped over time; even a battery that is user replaceable via a removable cover is *built in*, maybe they changed the wording to make it clearer.

user
ok, thax you very much

I'm trying to create a PDF document from an HTML document.Of course it's easy to do this using the built-in PDF Printer, however, this does not retain hyperlinks.I've tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/">wkhtmltopdf</a> which looked very promising, but it crashes on every attempt.Is anyone aware of any other options for generating a PDF document from an HTML document while retaining URL links?

You can do this using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat.html" rel="nofollow">Adobe Acrobat</a>.In Acrobat, go to File-> Create PDF-> From File. Select your HTML doc, let it do a bit of work, and then use File-> Save As to save it.All hyperlinks will be intact.

In Mac OS X, what causes the change in file permissions?For example, consider that the operating system was terminated abnormally. On a subsequent boot, randomly (or possibly those files that were open at the instant of termination) files have their permissions changed. They differ.What is the cause?

agent
First of all - random errors creep into any system. Modern hard drives have billions of bits stored and when you ask for a file to be written as 0101011 sometimes the machine writes 0101001 and if it's writing the permissions bits, there's your answer. If you do the math, assuming 99.99% accuracy would mean more than one error is on everyone's hard drive most of the time.Things get cut off in the middle of finishing. Electrical noise crops up and messes up the signal, cosmic rays hit your memory chip and flip a bit, some program code isn't perfect so the math gets done wrong.Then you have all the times another program wants to change the permissions and there is disagreement. Permission errors are usually logged to the system log so when you have a problem, have a look, maybe run permission repair to fix up the programs installed by apple.When in doubt - go to the source:<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2963" rel="nofollow">Troubleshooting permissions issuesin Mac OS X</a><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1452" rel="nofollow">About Disk Utility's Repair DiskPermissions feature</a>and <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1448" rel="nofollow">some warnings and errors shouldjust be ignored</a>

user
Thanks for a succinct answer. The majority of the permission errors I have observed in my Mac occur with Java (1.6.0 jdk), and the JavaVM.Framework. They occur repeatedly.

agent
Something like that sounds programatic or software since random errors should be distributed randomly. FSeventer or fs_usage might be worth deploying to see who is accessing those files. Highly concerning to have developer code self destructing like that. I might add them to a spotlight and time machine exclusion list temporarily to see if it's a collision of worlds between fseventsd / mds and java file IO. Curious if your filesystem is HFS+ journaled case-insensitive. I've seen other fs choices go wonky from time to time.

user
@neoneye, @bmike : Used FSEventer. The permissions change occurs in the same aforementioned directory, and each time Disk Utility "repairs" it, the permissions revert to their previous state, and this seems to be stuck in an endless loop. Possibly a conflicting configuration change by an application, or recurring false alarms by Disk Utility?I don't see any changes occurring prior to running Disk Utility though.

agent
Wow. Keep in mind that Disk Utility just reads the receipts database that say how Apple wanted the files to be installed. If another program modifies them, Disk Utility doesn't agree with the changes so it's a game of cat and mouse. We know the cat is Disk Utility - fs_usage might let you know which program is the mouse.

user
Disk utility repairs the permissions, yet on a subsequent re-run of Disk Utility, the same permissions which got repaired are repaired again. I kept fs_usage running, there was no application/process which attempted an access to said directories/files. Could it be that Disk utility's attempted repairs on these folders/files aren't working at all?

agent
I hadn't even thought of that. Very possible - fs_usage will let you snoop on Disk Utility, too :-)

user
Yeah, I didn't see any activity from disk utility either. Okay as this appears to be repeatedly connected with one directory only, guess I should give it a rest :).

On Lion I installed an extension which game me the ability to use middle click to open and close tabs, and I used Better Touch Tool (BTT) to use a 3 finger tap to act as a middle click.Since using Mountain Lion DP4, and subsequently the final release with Safari 6, I am only able to open tabs with a middle click, and I have to use keyboard shortcuts or by clicking on the tab close X.Is there anything which will give me middle click to close a tab which works on Safari 6 under Mountain Lion available now?

I've set up the same 3 finger middle click gesture in BTT and it works great with <a href="http://www.machangout.com" rel="nofollow">Glims for Safari</a>'s middle click to close setting.

Recently, I’ve received a couple of spam event invitations in Calendar on my Mac. The most recent had only Chinese text, and recurred at 5:46am every day.I am able to decline these by clicking on the invitations button in the toolbar (that only appears when an invitation comes in). However, ideally I’d like to not receive these spam invitations at all.As I’ve never received a genuine invitation through Calendar, I thought I might be able to turn off the invitation feature. However, I can’t see any controls for this in Calendar preferences or the Internet Account system preferences.Through what mechanism do these invitation arrive? If I understood what mechanism it was, I might be able to turn it off. I have two Calendar accounts enabled: iCloud, and Facebook. I can’t see anything in my e-mail, so I presume they’re not regular e-mail spam.Since first writing this question, I’ve had a similar invitation come through in Reminders:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XKOYd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

agent
It's simply that anyone can send an email to you. If spam rules don't block it, Apple software (with default settings) processes the invitation before you can take any action.To prevent this automatic processing, try this. Log in to <a href="http://www.icloud.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iCloud</a> on the web, open your calendar and go to ⚙ > Preferences (in the lower left corner). Under Advanced tab you’ll find an option to receive calendar invitations by e-mail instead of directly to your calendar.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kf6cD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
Hey that looks good — I’ve given that a go, it’ll be interesting to see if any more spam ones come through and show up in my e-mail.I know! I’ve since had a similar spam invitation appear in Reminders, which sadly does not have an equivalent settings screen on iCloud.com.

i have configured my Google APP email account on my new MACbook Pro (OS x 10.9.4). it was working fine for couple of days but now any attachment that i try to save it get save with ZERO size. Note: this problem is only with Encrypted Folders. if i download the save attachment to unencrypted folder, there is no problem encrypted

agent
Google APP email uses Google designed Encryption.To set it up you need to use the <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6105277?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google Apps Message Encryption Quick Start Guide.</a>For the Attachment settings see the Google instructions  <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2364580?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Attachment compliance setting</a>Basically what it means is you have to tell Google APP how to handle the attachments.To configure Attachment compliance settings for your domain or organizational unit:Sign in to the Google Admin console.From the dashboard, go to Apps &gt; Google Apps &gt; Gmail &gt; Advanced settings.In the Organizations section, highlight your domain or the organizational unit for which you want to configure settings (see Configure advanced settings for Gmail for more details).Scroll down to the Attachment compliance section:    If the setting's status is Not configured yet, click Configure (the "Add setting" dialog box displays).    If the setting's status is Locally applied, click Edit to edit an existing setting (the "Edit setting" dialog box displays), or click Add another to add a new setting (the "Add setting" dialog box displays).    If the setting’s status is Inherited, click View to view the inherited setting, or click Add another to add a new setting (the "Add setting" dialog box displays).When you're finished with your changes, click Add setting or Save to close the dialog box.

but how it was working at the first place. What Google App encryption setting have to do with my local hard drive.

agent
the Google setting would make sure the attachments are forwarded as encrypted, which is not the case now, they come over as not encrypted, if i understood you right. The attachments are forwarded but not as part of encrypted email !

user
i am using encryption at rest. i have followed this link http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/encrypt-mac-folder/ to create encrypted folder. i am saving the attachment to this folder. there is no encryption used anywhere else.

I dragged a software (Abbyy Finereader 8 - old version) to external disc and noticed that it does not work there. I dragged it back and noticed it does not work there because of some internal problems, probably in registers. I removed the drag-and-drop Abbyy Finereader 8 and installed it again. The same problem persists. How can you clean the registers and other materials related to the installation? I want to install the app then afterwards again. The installation package does not have any app to fix the application. 

agent
There is no registry on OS X. Related files get distributed in your user's or systems library (usually Application Support, and Preferences).To completely uninstall an Application either use the official Uninstaller if the developer/company provides one or depend on external tools like <a href="http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/" rel="nofollow">AppCleaner</a>.

user
Please, put a reference for your claim that there is no registers in OSX. I can recall that there are "functional" registers in OSX.

agent
I wouldn't know of registry in the style of windows. What do you mean?

user
A register is one of a small set of data holding places that are part of a computer processor. A register may hold a computer instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data. This suggests me that this kind of registers can be in OSX. Then, there are CPU registers which is not the topic here.
