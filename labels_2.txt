I've updated from Yosemite to 10.11.1 on my mid 2014 macbook pro a few days ago. I've got a WLAN in my apartment (for other gadgets), but since the signal is a bit weak at my desk, I have connected the macbook to the router using a LAN cable and a thunderbolt-ethernet adapter and switched WLAN off on the macbook. All was well on Yosemite, but El Capitan insists on switching on WLAN during most boots. Is there any way to prevent this without removing admin rights from my user and without removing the WLAN network from the list of known networks?I'm concerned about the potential security issues (in case it might connect to open networks when I'm traveling). It's also a nuisance because WLAN seems to take priority over the ethernet connection, which means I have a slow and unstable connection until I remember to switch WLAN off again.I guess I could create a new user without admin rights. Since I made sure that admin rights are necessary to activate WLAN that should prevent the issue, but I would prefer to avoid this "solution".

Your question touches upon a few different areas so I will aim to address these individually:Disabling a network serviceYou did not mention how you were disabling the Wi-Fi (i.e. WLAN) service, however there are generally two ways to do so from System Preferences in OS X:Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then NetworkClick Wi-Fi or the custom-named service from the service list on the leftClick Turn Wi-Fi off, then close the System Preferences windowAlternatively:Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then NetworkClick Wi-Fi or the custom-named service from the service list on the leftClick the gear icon (⚙), then Make service inactive, then click ApplyBoth methods should persist through a reboot or shutdown. Neither method requires removing any known networks, as you were concerned about, and both should result in the service being disabled until turned on again using the same method.It is important to note that if you click Turn Wi-Fi off in the method above, it is necessary to close the System Preferences window. If you reboot or shutdown without doing so, the option will not persist. Similarly, if you disable Wi-Fi from the menu bar icon (top-right of screen) the setting will not survive a reboot or shutdown.If, as you mention, the service is activated again after following one of the methods above, I would suggest removing the service completely (by selecting it from the service list and clicking the delete or — icon) then recreating it using the same settings, perhaps under a different name (e.g. WLAN Test).Note: You can always Revert any changes you make before Applying them in Network preferences. Be careful not to lose any details that you otherwise don't have written down.Protecting against open networksAs you suggested, it's wise to be concerned about the potential risks associated with open Wi-Fi networks, and you can at least opt out of joining these automatically:Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then NetworkClick Wi-Fi or the custom-named service from the service list on the leftEnable the Ask to join networks checkbox:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5nxOxm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>As described, known networks will be joined automatically. If no known networks are available a selection dialog will appear on-screen, giving you the option to join any available, but unknown, Wi-Fi network.For additional protection you can require the administrator password when changing networks:Click Advanced... then enable the Change networks checkbox under the heading Require administrator authorization to:Adjusting network service orderIt's generally advisable to prioritise your network services by their reliability, from most to least reliable, to give you the best experience when using multiple connections. In your case — since WLAN traffic appears to be taking priority over other traffic — this means giving the wired thunderbolt-to-ethernet service priority over your WLAN :Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then NetworkClick the gear icon (⚙), and select Set Service Order... as shown below<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cc8WIm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>In the panel that appears arrange the services by dragging them to the desired order, for example:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xjGsrm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Click OK, then ApplyThe system will attempt to utilise services in the order that you specified above. If a service is not available (e.g. cable disconnected, no network available) it will fall back to the next service, if any, until a valid service is found, or alternatively all services fail.

user
Thank you. This is helpful. I'd already tried both alternatives for turning off WLAN. However, I've now reduced priority of the WLAN service. Let's see if that helps. I'll wait with accepting this answer until I know which part of this answer actually helped, if any. Btw. Apple's German localization is sometimes weird. I would have never guessed that that option means "Ask to join new networks".OK. Your first method of `Turn Wi-Fi off` doesn't persist, but your alternative  `Make service inactive` seems to be what one has to do. I believe this is an example of bad user interface. If I turn something off using a provided UI element, I expect it to stay off unless I'm warned that it doesn't. Thanks again!

agent
@Roland To simplify things further, you may want to configure multiple network 'locations'. Each 'location' can be configured with different interfaces enabled or disabled, and different settings for each. You could, for example, have a 'Home' location with your wired interface enabled and everything else disabled, and a 'Work' location with Wi-Fi enabled and everything else disabled. Switching between locations is as easy as changing the current location in the drop-down menu at the top of the Network preferences window.

user
I'm sorry, but I have to unaccept this. It didn't solve the problem. Even though I have completely deactivated the WLAN service, El Capitan still occasionally tries to connect to available networks. The only difference now is that it isn't successful anymore.

agent
@Roland Can you try disabling the "Ask to join new networks" option?

user
I'll try if that makes a difference.

I have reason to believe that my iCloud account was recently breached and whoever did it is trying to lock my devices. I am aware that this is done through Find my IPhone and that they have set it to lost mode. However, when I go to Find my IPhone and I view the details of my mac, it simply says locked 6 minutes ago without an option to un-lost mode it. Is there any way to fix this / am I doing something wrong or do I have to go to an apple store and prove I own the device and such?Thanks all,Jimmy

agent
You would only have to go into an Apple store and prove ownership if your device is "bricked" after iOS/macOS is erased (meaning you cannot login to it due to forgotten password and/or Apple ID email address). When iCloud.com says the device is "locked" it does not mean "bricked," it simply means the screen is locked, like with your pin.   It sounds like all you need to do is enable 2-Factor authentication in your Apple ID/iCloud account, plus change your password. This will prevent whomever "breached" the account from logging in again. See: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915</a>

user
The problem is that someone managed to get access already and has locked my mac with Find my iPhone. The screen looks like this: [img of screen](https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/500-locked-mac1.png?w=500&h=263); this means they have already locked my mac and I am not sure how to unlock it, would this be similar to a "bricked" device? Thanks!

agent
Afraid so, yes. You need to produce a receipt and go into the Apple Store to get it unlocked (if you don't know the code). Good luck.BTW, if this MacBook is stolen (not saying you did, but just in general) it is worthless now, FYI.@Jimmy, can you award me the answer here, please? I believe I properly answered your question. Thanks.

user
I'm going to the store today so I'll see how it goes, thanks for the help

I have a 13" 2012 non-retina MacBook Pro that I intend on upgrading with a Samsung Evo 850 SSD. I have watched some tutorials and for the most part, I think I know what to do on the hardware side of things but I have two questions for the software side after the disk has been successfully installed. Question 1. Can I use the recovery menu (accessed by hitting command + r on boot) to both format, and install a version of MacOS? Question 2. If so, do I need to initialize the disk before installing it? Or can I literally unbox the SSD, install it in my MBP, and then format/install MacOS via recovery?

agent
What you do depends on how you want to setup your Mac. More specifically, do you want to just do a totally clean installation of macOS, or do you want to migrate your existing setup (including users/data) across to the SSD?Regardless, you will need to format the SSD first. Probably the easiest way to proceed is to connect it to your Mac via an external enclosure and then use Disk Utility to format it. If you haven't got an external enclosure (or another way to connect the SSD), then you could insert the SSD into the MacBook and opt to run macOS Recovery from the Internet. To do this, hold down OptionCommandR (or, if that doesn't work, try ShiftOptionCommandR). NOTE: If you proceed this way then:It may be worth you testing to make sure you can boot into macOS Recovery from the internet prior to going to the trouble of physically installing the SSD into your MacBook.The only way to migrate all your data is if you have a Time Machine backup on an external disk (i.e. if you don't have a TM backup and want to keep your current setup, then you will need to either make a TM backup first, or have a way of connecting the SSD or the internal drive to your Mac for migrating the data across).Regardless, once booted into macOS Recovery, run Disk Utility to format the SSD.Once it’s formatted you can install macOS, but how you proceed will depend on how you want to setup your Mac. More specifically, do you want to just do a totally clean installation of macOS and then install software etc as you need, or do you want to migrate your existing setup (including users/data) from a Time Machine backup?If you're planning to migrate data from a Time Machine backup, then take a look at <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT201250" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to use Time Machine to back up or restore your Mac</a>.

user
Thank you for the detailed reply. I do not wish to transfer over anything from my other mac. I'd like to do a fresh install. When you say "test to make sure you can boot into MacOS recovery" do you just mean try booting into the recovery menu right now? I have done so and that shouldn't be an issue. It sounds like I'll be okay then. All I need to do is install, go to MacOS recovery, format the drive, and then install MacOS.

agent
Well, what I mean is that if you remove the current internal drive, then there is no macOS Recovery partition stored locally anymore. If that's the case, the only way to boot from macOS Recovery is to do it from the Internet. So, by testing to see if you can do that without any problems, I'm suggesting you manually do that beforehand as a test (i.e. by using the keyboard shortcuts in my answer). This will take a little time (it is over the internet after all), but it's probably more convenient then installing the SSD and then finding for some reason you actually can't boot via the internet. :)

user
Excellent. I ended up just cloning the drive but I appreciate your advice.

I recently installed VMWare Fusion and added Windows 7.  Now when I right-click on a text file and choose Open With, there's an option to open with Notepad in Windows 7.  This is not something I want enabled.  How can I remove this choice?

agent
One solution is to install <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14618/rcdefaultapp" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="RCDefaultApp">RCDefaultApp</a> and change the file association for text files.Another solution is to disable Windows application integration for that virtual machine. To do that open the virtual machine, go to the Virtual Machine menu and select Settings.... Change the settings for Default Applications. You likely want to uncheck Run Windows applications from you Mac's Applications folder

user
Looks handy, thank you.  Unfortunately it appears that it's no longer maintained; at least one commenter notes it doesn't work with Mountain Lion.

agent
Hmm, I use it with Mountain Lion.

user
Nice, @Hair.  Changing the settings via Fusion is the right answer.  I've been all through those settings, but didn't see that.  Note that a reboot is required for the changes to take place.  Thank you!

I've just bought an iPhone 4 and I want to connect to the internet but I can't do so.Do I need an apple id to use an iPhone?Definitely I've contacted my dataplan service and they are saying I should be able to connect to the internet now. But i can't!I've waited over 3 weeks but still no internet. These are the messages i get from 1627:  May 8, 2011 5:33 PM    Dear Valued Customer, your GSM Mi  World Mobile service has been  activated as requested.

Right now if i open safari it just won't connect.

No - you only need a correctly provisioned data plan and working iPhone software. There isn't much that you can mis-configure unless you jailbreak or start mucking with <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/143088/2009/10/carriersettings.html" rel="nofollow">custom iPhone carrier settings profiles</a>. iPhone data can break or be misconfigured on the carrier end - even if SMS and voice calls work, there can still be a problem with the data service so you may need to get help from your carrier that is providing your data access. It could also be a software issue and Apple is the best place to get that sorted.Your question is basically how do I systematically troubleshoot iPhone data and/or teach myself how to operate my new phone. (no offense, but it's hard to determine from a one sentence question what your level of comfort is with iPhone data terms and how it may break.)You might want to get some help from Apple or the carrier since the internet works as long as you are in working Wifi or your data plan is active on the iPhone. Troubleshooting an issue by back and forth on a discussion board is very hard so it's best to get real-time assistance when you are sitting in front of your computer to update the software if needed.<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/</a> has some great getting started tips if you want to work through it yourself.Specifically <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1976" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1976</a> documents the concepts and has an express lane link to get support directly from Apple to narrow down the cause - if 3G is showing in the menu bar it's not some obvious error or switch but something obscure or a carrier issue.

user
ok my data plan is active. i can sms / make calls etc. Im not trying to connect using wifi. i'm trying to connect using 3gs, how may i do it?

agent
sms travels over a command channel unused by voice, voice can be active and data not provisioned. Have you informed  your carrier that data you are paying for isn't working and have their tech verify that dataplan is actually active on their wireless network for your SIM?

user
yes i've called them and they say that its active. But i still can't connect!

agent
Then you can strike that off the list. Hang in there - you'll know how these things work before long. Next up is getting help from Apple in person or over the internet to work through the potential device issues. Good Luck!

@bmike i've updated the question with more info

agent
Three weeks of patience! You must be a saint. In the settings app, what are the following values? Version, carrier, modem firmware. Have you connected to iTunes and updated the iPhone software? Also enter field test mode by calling \*3001#12345#\* - I'm curious what PDP Context List - 0 - lists. You should have an ip address, PDP Type of "IP" and access point name iPhone

user
@bmike my carrier is SGP-M1-3GSM. I don't know about the version / modem firmware (where is it shown?). I've connected to ITunes to put some songs in but I don't know if i did (or how to) update the iphone software. When i call 3001#12345# i get "Error performing request No Network Service"

My company invited me to join its iCloud calendar.On my iPhone I didn't activate "Calendar" in the iCloud settings until now for data privacy reasons.Will my private calendar on my iPhone be synced to my personal iCloud as soon as I activate the "Calendar" switch in the iCloud settings? Or does my private local calendar stay local and I'd need to transfer my local calendar to iCloud manually if desired?

agent
You can have a seperate "On My Mac" calendar, which stays local. You can then have additional calendars for iCloud—only those calendars will be synced. You don't have to have iCloud activated for calendars to be invited either. Simply create a new "On my Mac" calendar, call it "Work" if you want, and add the event invitations to that.<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph2682?locale=en_US" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.apple.com/kb/ph2682?locale=en_US</a>Update:As mentioned in my comment below. If you have an existing local calendar e.g. "On My Mac" or "On My iPad" and you sign into iCloud, you will be asked "What would you like to do with your existing calendars". Click Cancel to keep your existing local calendar.The local calendar has to exist before signing into iCloud. I couldn't find a way to add a local calendar if already signed into iCloud.You will now be able to create a "Work" iCloud calendar and access the shared iCloud calendar. You will also have the private local calendar.

user
I want to see the calendar entries of my company in my iPhone on the go i.e. when I'm travelling and a colleague adds an appointment to the iCloud calendar of the company this appointment shall appear in my calendar app on the iPhone. Is that possible?https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2694?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US says: "Invitees to a private calendar must have an iCloud account."

agent
I did some tests on my iPad-iOS 10.3. I wan't able to add a local calendar while I was signed into iCloud. However, I signed out, created a new "On My iPad" local calendar and created an event. I then signed back in. iCloud asked "What you you like to do with your existing calendars? Merge or Cancel". I Cancelled. I can now see a seperate local calendar on my iPad, that is not available on my other devices. I think this is what you're after? You can now go to Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar to set where your personal events can be saved.

user
Thanks for pointing this out. I already have a local calendar with lots of private dates. Can I be sure that iOS asks me "What you you like to do with your existing calendars? Merge or Cancel" as soon as I activate iCloud calendar integration. If that's the case that would be a solution indeed.

Running macOS 10.14.2. Safari 12.0.1.Symptoms:Safari redirects searches through proxy to bingChrome redirects searches through proxy to bingIn Privacy Settings, under Automation "Finder" with no icon has access to SafariWhen removing it, a preferences pop up shows up.Immediately after a memory warning shows up and cancel the preferences pop up."Finder" reappears under "Automation" with safari checked.When quitting Safari, it launches alone. (Can't close safari)Attempts:Used "tccutil reset AppleEvents", both pop ups appear once after execution.Used Avira anti-virus with quick scan it found and eliminated 1 virus, ran a full scan and it found and removed 4. Did not run it again.No clue how to remove this without disabling SIP which is not something I necessarily want to do, nor would I know how to exactly find "Finder". It also seems to be using some exploit to grant itself Automation privileges even after you uncheck them via some memory issue that triggers the memory warning. How can malware like this be cleaned?

agent
I wouldn't disable SIP if you have active malware on your system. If you have another Mac you can use or borrow, I'd boot your Mac into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Target Disk Mode</a>, connect it to the other Mac with a Thunderbolt cable, and then run both Avira and Malwarebytes on it from the other Mac. This allows the antimalware software to ignore any SIP protection on the TDM'd Mac and perform a full clean.If you can't use another Mac, then install a bootable copy of macOS onto an external drive, boot from that, and do the same.If you can't do either, boot into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Safe Mode</a>, run Avira, and then if it finds something, let it clean it and then reboot again into Safe Mode. Now run Malwarebytes and do the same. Always reboot after a pass where it found something, because whatever it is that it found may be preventing you from finding anything further until you reboot with it gone.

user
After every pass Avira finds a different number of viruses. Never 0.

agent
Are you attempting cleanup while booted from the infected filesystem, or using another option I mentioned earlier?

user
Safe Mode option. However I ended up switching to malware bytes and it worked.

TL;DRSince it seems obvious that at present Apple can do nothing to help me: I need some way of getting as much of my content (music/apps/contacts/etc) out of this account... what can I do? All of my music/apps/contacts since like 2004 are in this account!The answer which gives me the most ways of extracting my purchases will get the answer vote and bounty.If my password is ever stolen I will not be able to change it, I would have to have the account locked and I would lose thousands of dollars worth of purchases!Ok so I had enabled Apple's two-step authentication in order to have more security. It told me to "save the recovery key in a safe place like your wallet" so I just took that suggestion.Now, I was robbed. My wallet AND iPhone (my authorized device) were both stolen. Now I have no way of managing my iCloud account so I cannot:change my passwordpurchase anything from an iPhoneIf I want to purchase new apps I have created a new account, but if there is an app already purchased on my old account I have to switch back and download it... however they changed it so now I cannot switch accounts on my iPhone for 90 days!The only thing I can think to do, is to try and extract as much as I can from that account (contacts, music, apps) and then store them somewhere...I am kind of sad that I have lost functionality and Apple has made there literally be NO WAY to recover without at least 2 of the recovery options (my 2 were stolen).So this is also now LESS secure, because if my password becomes compromised I have no way of changing it (can't manage account with only password now).Any idea what steps I should take? One I can think of is to go to all my accounts that I had used my iCloud e-mail for and change that. But as for my app purchases and music purchases, I am pretty much hosed.Will I be able to stop using the old account entirely (I guess have them lock it) but before I do that extract out my content for use? Music I can burn to MP3, but apps... I don't think I will be able to get updates for apps purchased under that account if I lock the account.EDIT just realized my apple developer account is bound to this login as well, FML

agent
The way this is supposed to work is to log in to <a href="https://appleid.apple.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://appleid.apple.com</a> and have several devices for authentication.Have you double checked that you don't have SMS as one of your options? If so, you can just get another SMS capable cell phone from the carrier using your number and be able to log in to reissue a new recovery key.To paraphrase the KB article - <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5577" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5577</a>  If you lose permanently access to all of your trusted devices AND your recovery key, you will not be able to use that AppleID. Hopefully you can either recover your phone or the wallet (police report and/or reward work in different situations) after a few days and add in some more items, regenerate your recovery key or disable the two-factor security on your account.Also, you will want to make a phone call to developer support and ask if they have any way to assist you in enrolling another trusted device so that you can continue to do business with them. The developer program has far more ability to tell you from a random impersonator due to the legal forms and verification you may have filled out to enter the program and sell an app.Also realize that Apple intentionally set this up knowing that some people would be in your situation and make sure you acknowledge that they don't have to help you out, but if they can find a way to, you would really appreciate it. However, since you have thousands of dollars at stake, I can't imagine you wouldn't be able to call into developer support and work with them to regain access as a one-time exception to the policy. Heck, Apple might be able to assist with a letter that corroborates a police report of the theft and open up options to claim this against insurance.Lastly, check with your insurance since the cost to re-establish your accounts and purchases might just be covered. Your sure move is to get a new AppleID move on, securing it with more layers (and spread over more than one location) of verification devices. Hopefully, you can recover one of the items that was stolen and avoid the lengthy process of convincing either Apple or an insurance agent to help you out of this understandable but painful predicament.

user
this part cracks me up: As long as you remember your Apple ID password and still have access to one of your trusted devices, you can sign in and create a new Recovery Key.Go to My Apple ID, select "Manage your Apple ID," and sign in.Under Edit your Apple ID, select "Password and Security."Under Recovery Key, select Replace Lost Key and follow the onscreen instructions.NOPE: it asks for the RKEY when I try to login

agent
I don't doubt you're locked out - and without seeing your list of devices, your only avenue may be to enter the key that has been lost. I figured describing how it's _supposed_ to work was a long shot at helping your predicament. I wish I had any reports of Apple deviating from the policy, but I haven't heard of a case where they budged on this yet.

user
yeah I hope they fix this soon, not only is it a security flaw because I can't change my password but also I am not going to make any new purchases until this is addressed, I don't want to tie up any more money in a system that I could be locked out of like this

agent
@ioSamurai That's a good plan. What has come of your attempt to call into developer support. Did you open a line of communication with them to get your options to recover the account and/or transfer your app to a new account? My guess is developer support would be able to talk to iCloud and get an engineer to add a verified cell phone to your list of recovery devices and then let you reset things as normal. You might also be able to convince them of a purchase made in person at a retail store for a new iPod touch and grant that device permissions over the account.

user
I have yet to call developer support, I will try that soon. I am wondering if the security is such that not even anyone at Apple can access the account. Kind of like how a password can be hashed.

Sometimes I want to make a screenshot and found that if I do that on a 4k screen, then the screenshot is quite clear (and is in a high resolution).So I can do this when my Macbook Pro is connected to a 4k display.  But let's say if I am on a trip, how do I make the Macbook Pro show or think it is showing in 4k?  I think this is possible even when we don't install any driver or software, because we can plug in a 4k display and choose "mirror the 2 displays" and the Macbook Pro native screen will pretend that it is a 4k screen, and any screen capture there will be in 4k resolution.So the question is, if I temporarily don't have a 4k display, say on a business trip, how do I tell the Mac to show the native screen in 4k or even 5k?

agent
It depends on which 4K you're referring to; if you're talking about the "actual" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution" rel="nofollow">4K</a> (4096 × 2160), then: no (though you can come close).However, if you're talking about the UHD 4K definition (See the link to Wikipedia above), which is 3840 × 2160, you can do it using 3. party utilities such as <a href="http://www.quickresapp.com/" rel="nofollow">QuickRes</a> (paid), <a href="http://www.madrau.com/" rel="nofollow">SwitchResX</a> (paid), or <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/87351306/RDM.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">Retina Display Mode</a> (free).I've used QuickRes for a couple of years and definitely find it worth the $5. It's also the app I used to test.Keep in mind: this only applies to the 15", the 13" can "only" display up to 3360 × 2100.

user
I feel somewhat worried if it is to download an app from a random place and run it on the Mac.  Is this the official page for it: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/vi9yf/set_your_retina_macbook_pros_resolution_to/  As the page says, is there a command line version.  If so, at least I know what is going on. By the way, is RDM the same as going to Mac's Settings, Display, and Resolution: Scaled: More Space? If I do that and do a screenshot, the image is 3840 x 2160 also

agent
Seems reasonable to be cautious. I think that it is the same as the settings. When the resolution apps were made in 2012-13, those options weren't available natively, now they are, it seems. Then please just disregard that part of my answer :) I did run the app on my machine though and nothing bad happened.It *is* indeed the same as the settings. Just tested to make sure

user
I tried similar things with the 12 inch Macbook, and was able to get a width of 2880, so that's close to 3k and quite impressive. And then, wouldn't it theoretically be able to go up to 3840, since it can drive such a display?

agent
I'm afraid not. The graphics chip might be able to handle it but the actual display need to be able handle it too.

user
the actual display needs to be able to handle it? I think it is just some software or driver merely taking 3 dots and show it as 2, or take 2 dots and showing it as 1, etc

When browsing through Apple Music, there are curated Apple Music Playlists.Now, I can add each song of the Apple Music Playlist to "My Music" by right clicking and selecting "Add to my Music". That's very inconvenient, when I want to add all songs of that playlist to "My Music". Is there any easier way? Any one-click solution?

agent
Yes you can, on both iTunes and your Apple device. You didn't mention which device specifically, but on iTunes, look for the + icon or the ..., which you can click and Add to My Music as well.Check out these screenshots below on iTunes. I boxed the + icon on both pictures because that is the simpler approach, but you can also click the ...:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9z5FG.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7nhDL.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

Hm, yes... But it doesn't do what it should, i think! If I click on "Add to My Music", wait for a bit. Then click on it again, to make sure the entry "Add to My Music" isn't showing up anymore. Then go back to "My Music" and search for a track, e.g. Drake - Legend. It does not show up... Shouldn't it?

agent
Ah yes. Well in perfect circumstances this does work. But what you're facing is what many users are facing too. Apple Music, which relies on icloud music library, is very buggy, and changes you make to your library don't work automatically. I've faced this issue with rating songs. There isn't a fix for this really yet, but you can try restarting, signing out, etc

user
Ok cool, thx for clarifying/veryfing that ;) Yeah iCloud/iTunes Match has been buggy for years now. I am really surprised it's such a disaster ...Finally found a solution, I've described it on my blog: https://blog.benmarten.me/2015/12/24/How-to-Add-all-Songs-of-a-Apple-Music-Playlist-to-My-Music-Library/

I want to set up iCloud keychain on my apple devices. To do so I went to settings > iCloud > keychain and turned it on and a button 'Approve with security code' appeared. It asked my iCloud security code and after it asks for 6 digit verification code that has been sent to my old phone number that I no longer have access to. After trying to find where I can change my number. I already went to settings > phone > my number and entered my current number but the phone still has sends the verification code to the old number.I am using an iPhone 6 with iOS 8.1Also tried to set it up on the a macbook with Yosemite but it also send the verification code to the old number.

Login into <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">https://appleid.apple.com/</a> and you will be able to change under Phone Numbers.

I have a Macbook Pro running Lion 10.7.3. It has an SSD with 2 partitions: the OS is located in partition 1 and my user home is in partition 2.Everything was working fine, but some days ago I had to restart the notebook and now the OS says that it can not access to my user folders, I cannot navigate (via terminal) to the OS folders, like Library and others.I've tried many things, including run fsck and Disk Utility's to Repair Permissions but nothing works; what could happened? Suggestions to solve or try?

agent
Check in the  "User &amp; Groups" System Preferences, it looks like OS X may have somehow forgotten the path to where your "Home directory:" is at.If you can still login, verify that your Path is still what you set in System Preferences for your "Home directory:" path.If you can't log in, then try logging in as another Admin user to fix your home directory location. Try to login as that user and then edit, verify where the OS thinks your home directory is for your primary user account.   <a href="http://www.rit.edu/its/services/desktop_support/mac/xforcenewadminacccount.html" rel="nofollow">Create a new Mac OS X adminstrator account without an existing administrator password</a> might be helpful in your situation, so that you can have another admin account to help you trouble shoot.Restart the computer in Mac OS X single user mode by holding Command-S at startup.Mount the computer's drive for read/write access. To do so, type the following command at the command prompt, and then press Enter:% mount -uw /Remove the file that identifies that the initial run of the "Mac OS X Setup Assistant" has been completed, with this command at the command prompt, followed by Enter:% rm /var/db/.applesetupdone  #Update on Lion it looks like its .AppleSetupDoneRestart the computer by entering this command, followed by Enter.% rebootThe Mac OS X Setup Assistant screen should appear after the reboot, just as it does when you start up a brand new computer or upgrade to a new version of Mac OS X.Create a new user account with the Setup Assistant. Be sure to name this user something different than the admin user that already exists on the system, and use a strong password (see "Mac OS X password tips"). At the end of the Setup Assistant process, the system will automatically log into this new user account. The account will have a unique ID (UID) that is one higher than the last user that was on the system, and will have all administration privileges.Log in as the new user, and then edit the "Home directory:" Advanced Options path for your primary user.

user
Hi, no, I don't have another user, but I can try to log as root or create another one and see what happens.. I've already tried to reestablish the home directory path.. but no luck... the folder "disappeared" ... :SI'll try to follow your tips at home at night,... The new user should be named the one that I have now (the one that I've lost the home folders)?

agent
No create a separate and different user name, you don't want two user with the same name, this account would be something to help you diagnose issues on your machine and not to replace your current user account.Interesting, I would try to navigate to where your "external" home directory is and verify that the User ID and Group ID of the folder and all things in it matches that of your primary user account. Does it?

user
Hi dude!... I've tried your suggestions and I found some interesting things..I created a new user with admin role and logged in with it.. I can see the lost folders "but" they are in another partition and the group is a different one... I don't know how, but I have another partition, really strange because my ssd does not have free space. it's named "Datos 1" and the original one was called "Datos", I can see both of them, but it seems that the OS not...any suggestion?.. I could backup my important data and delete the partition and create it again and reinstall... but I believe there should be something easier...

agent
Can you take a screen shot of your Disk Utility Application window, showing the internal drives and partitions on the right of the window. And share a link or post a picture of it.

user
Hi Daniel... here are some pictures about it..http://i.imgur.com/5Cmjc.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/NTppS.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/GkiC9.pngIs this helpful? I've tried many things but nothing works...

agent
What is in Datos vs Datos 1 when you `cd` in them in the /Volumes.  Are they the same different, which one has your data in it?

user
I believe I've solved it :) I renamed the partition(Datos 1) where i believed my data was, then updated the home folder of the affected user to point to this "new" partition and everything was there... so the other partition(Datos) was created by who knows and that was the problem... Thanks a lot for your tips dude!

I believe my issue is different from all that I've read.  I live on a boat in a marina.  The marina has towers (transmitters) placed around in various spots.  The internet provider is Beacon wi-fi.  A big wi-fi provider for marinas around USA, Canada and Bahamas. So I get my password from the marina and log in. I use a MacBook Pro laptop which has an internal wi-fi antenna.  So there is no router or modem on board my boat.  My problem is the connection is extremely poor. When I finally get connected the reception is weak. Streaming a hockey or football game is almost impossible. Loading a page of text can be fast as times but usually takes 15 to 90 seconds to load when it's at it's best.  A 2 minute utube video can take 30 minutes.  My boat is about 200 feet from the closest tower of transmitters or whatever they might be called. There are several to chose from on my drop down list.  I have to constantly keep selecting a different one to get reconnected. The PHY Mode is 802.11G The RSSI: is sometimes as good as -59  but usually around -80 when I'm actually getting as good a reception as possible.  I've tried this trick. I bought an external wi-fi (looks like a memory stick) and a USB extension cord plugged into one of my ports.  I then got a large kitchen strainer and poked a hole in it at the bottom and fastened the wi-fi gizmo to it.  Then pointed it towards the transmitters on the poles on the wharfs.  It did make an improvement but it was minimal and not consistent plus it cost $100 so I returned the USB extension cord and the external wi-fi. Anybody want a free strainer with a hole in it?  I contacted Beacon wi-fi in Dallas and they say everything is good at their end.  I've contacted the marina and they say everything is good at their end.  Does anyone have any tricks other than what I've tried to improve my internet?

agent
I would recommend searching Amazon (or wherever) for a wifi range extender and finding one that would work on your boat. <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003ILWRLI" rel="nofollow">There's even one that is specifically for boats and comes with a 5M usb cable.</a> 

user
Any range extenders I've come across on line are designed to extend the range from a router or modem.  As in getting reception in your attic if the router or modem is in the living room.  As you read, my situation is different and the retailers don't think it will make any difference since it won't be hard wired to any incoming internet service.  I'm not sure why there would be range extenders designed for sailboats?  Perhaps I should mention that I'm on a large power boat with 110 outlets throughout the boat and I'm plugged into shore power.

agent
sorry, for boats, not sailboats in particular

I appreciate your input and I'll ask my marine supplier if they have anything. I may have overlooked the obvious source.  Thanks

I have an old laptop (which is definitely on its last strides). It's a MacBook Air Late 2010 and its running like a slug (I have abused the laptop beyond comprehension) so for its final year or two I want to get the most out of it. I already have a 2' monitor attached and I want to know if I get a GTX 970 and attach it with <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00LTAUTHE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">one of these things</a> (Using thunderbolt) if it will function properly and that I'm not burning $600 for something my computer can't handle.

agent
Unfortunately not, <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp618?locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">your Macbook</a> doesn't have Thunderbolt, only Mini DisplayPort. For best results, your mac should have Thunderbolt 2 to take full advantage of the speeds.By the way, I have Macbook 2011 and I had 2x Thunderbolt displays at 2560x1440 with my integrated HD3000 512mb without a problem. But it was fast as hell when I added a SATA3 SSD with 560mbps read. Hard drives are bottlenecking! :)

user
do you know if i could upgrade the ports to support thunderbolt instead of displayport?

Nope you can't, you need a newer Macbook. Thunderbolt 1 was released with Early 2011 Macbook and Thunderbolt 2 was released with Late 2013 Macbook.

@jw382 It depends on the version of Windows you are using.

At my workplace we pair program and sometimes need to get on a call with a remote team member. We also have quite a noisy office. We have USB headsets for these reasons. We, of course, use macs.In addition to the remote calls it would be great fun to be able to have music playing through both people's headsets and be able to talk over it. So some sort of ducking would be useful.We've tried creating an aggregate device as described <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3956">here</a> but it only sends audio from one mic, and you can't hear yourself talking. So unless you know some setting tweak we don't, an aggregate device won't work.I'm very close to creating my own utility at this point, but before I dive in and hurt my brain learning OSX audio, does anyone know something that will achieve what I want?

agent
I haven't tried this, but if you're <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2089460/a-tale-of-two-microphones.html" rel="nofollow">willing to experiment</a>:Try using (no joke) Garageband with your aggregated device setup.  No need to hit the record button, but you can use the monitor function to hear yourself speak.  And since it presumably knows what to do with both mics, you might both be able to speak.You may also use <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/" rel="nofollow">LineIn</a> to be able to hear yourself speak.  And finally, <a href="http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/" rel="nofollow">soundflower</a> may be useful if you need to shuttle audio from one app to another before making it to your headphones... like say background music from iTunes or whatever.~~~Update from OP:  Thanks, I ended up going with something based on the ideas in your  post but developed the solution on my own.

How can I change the location of the Music folder from /Users/Me/Music to an external drive, so that iTunes saves its stuff there? This is so that I can access the XML file that you can create from iTunes for Windows programs to use. And yes, I know that the file paths are not the same, but it will still be helpful.

You can set the folder iTunes uses directly in iTunes -> Preferences:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0T1dF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

I'm afraid not.From <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.0-15-iris-only-late-2013-retina-display-specs.html" rel="nofollow">Everymac</a>  *This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt.

it says "4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI", what about DP?

over HDMI @ 24Hz. Answer updated.

At least at 50Hz would be ok, but 24Hz is too irritating.

then you'll need to wait until Apple releases a machine or update that enables it. Even the Mac Pro can't do it as yet.

I am on a MBP Early 2011, running Snow Leopard and am facing a strange issue. If I boot up my system and try to connect to my external display using the MDP->VGA adapter, System Settings won't show the correct resolution for the secondary display. I can see 1440x1050 and 1600x1200, and even if I hit Detect Displays, nothing will change.What is my workaround? Connect using MDP->DVI adapter, which will identify the correct resolution of the display (1680x1050), and then fall back to the VGA Adapter to surprisingly see the native resolution of my display listed!!Do you guys know what is going on here? Thank you in advance.

agent
I had the exact same issue, it's to do with OS X not getting a confirmation from the monitor of it's correct resolution and picking random defaults. Your workaround is pretty much the best way to go, or you can try <a href="http://www.madrau.com/SRXv3/html/SRX/About.html" rel="nofollow">SwitchResX</a> and try a virtual solution.

user
I took a look at this software and tried it for a few days, but it is a shareware, and I don't feel like paying 14 euros for a thing that such an advanced OS should do. But thanks for the heads up, makes me feel less alone and paranoid. ;)

agent
If it helps your work around is better than mine. I ended up using another machine, connecting via VNC and then managing to get the full resolution which was probably one of the worst workarounds in the history of workarounds.

user
Wheat, as soon as you decide to support a technology, it is expected that you do it right, specially when you are paying $50 to get an adaptor. At least you should state that the support for such an old-fashioned technology is not fully implemented.

As there are quite some rumors, about iOS 11 dropping support for 32 bit apps, I need to know, how to tell if an app is 64-bit. I know, that if it was published after february 2015, or if it was updated after june 2015, it has to have 64-bit support. But the app in question - IPELA Communication Mobile by Sony Corporation - was last updated on June 10th 2015. How can i be absolutely sure, that - just in case the rumors come true - I can still use it?

agent
The easy way for me is to install the app on iOS 10.3 (or later) device. Then open the settings app.tap generaltap Abouttap ApplicationsiOS will report on the possibility to update all 32 bit apps you have installed on the device by letting you tap to each entry in the App Store where the developer web site is another tap away. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgGvW.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
Tapping "applications" doesn't do anything on my device. It's an iPhone SE with iOS 10.3

agent
iPhone SE clearly has 64 architecture in the processor - I wonder if it rolled out in 10.3.1 instead of 10.3 @kjubus. Any chance you can update to the current build of 10.3 ? Also, a clean reboot of the device can help if the settings app gets mixed up and doesn't compile the list as shown above.

user
Nope, doesn't work either on 10.3 or 10.3.1.If you can do it, could you install the IPELA app yourself and let me know? it's free on app store.

I'm trying to set up an Applescript to add the sender of a selected message in Apple Mail to a specific group in the Contacts app. By reconfiguring the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24711/is-there-a-way-to-add-all-of-the-recipients-of-an-email-to-a-group-folder-in-con">code provided in this answer</a>, I worked up the following but it isn't working. Any suggestions on what I am doing wrong?    tell application "Mail"    set theMessage to selection    tell application "Contacts"        set theGroup to "_TEST"    end tell    set theSender to sender of theMessage    tell application "Contacts"        set theName to name of theSender        set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:name of theSender}        add thePerson to theGroup    end tell    tell application "Contacts" to save    end tell

agent
Try this, it will create a contact with proper first name, last name and email address:tell application "Mail"set theMessages to selectionif theMessages is not {} then -- check empty list    set theSenderName to extract name from sender of item 1 of theMessages    set nameArray to my split(theSenderName, " ")    set theFirstName to item 1 of nameArray    set theLastName to last item of nameArray    set theEmail to extract address from sender of item 1 of theMessages    tell application "Contacts"        set theGroup to group "_TEST"        set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:theFirstName, last name:theLastName}        make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {label:"Work", value:theEmail}        add thePerson to theGroup        save    end tell    end ifend tellon split(theString, theDelimiter)    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theDelimiter    set theArray to every text item of theString    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters    return theArrayend splitThere were a few issues with your original attempt, here's how I worked around them.For starters, selection gives you a list of items (even if it's just a list of one), so you need to pick the first element from the selection.In mail, sender gives you a not very useful string with the name and email combined. extract name from and extract address from give you useful strings.The name string is the full name, but Contacts.app expects separate first and last names, so I split that string (using a handy function found <a href="http://erikslab.com/2007/08/31/applescript-how-to-split-a-string/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) to make a decent guess at first and last names. This may give unexpected results from strangely formatted names in emails.If you have any problems with this one, let me know and I'll see if I can fix them. In the future, it may be helpful to run the scripts in AppleScript Editor, and check the Event Log for details on what's failing (error messages are useful, if only to put into Google or give others a starting point for solving your problem).

user
that did the trick, thank you. The error log suggestion is helpful too, thanks. Your solution worked, but I get an error of "missing value" when I run it in the editor.

agent
Yeah, that's not an error so much as just not having a return value. The Applescript event log prints the return value of the last statement. In this case, it's just `save`, which returns nothing, if saved successfully. Nothing to worry about, but it does look ominous if you don't know why it's there.

user
Thanks for the clarification, slowly trying to understand AS syntax. That helps!

agent
No problem. AppleScript is a pretty nasty language IMO. The idea of an English-like scripting language sounds good on the surface, but you quickly realize it has serious problems. That said, it's still a useful way to get a lot of OS X-specific things accomplished.

user
I've discovered a limitation with this method: it creates a new entry every time. I have two groups, Pending and Current. I'd like to be able to add a new entry to Pending, but then later move that same contact to Current if/when their project goes forward.

I am trying to install an application through command line in OS X. This is what I am trying:hdiutil attach app.dmgcd /Volumes/appvolumeinstaller -pkg app.pkg -target "/"This works fine, however, I am not able to get an output from the installer command from which I can capture the amount of progress made and the time/amount remaining. I tried the verbose optioninstaller -verbose -pkg app.pkg -target "/"But this only prints output like installer: Optimizing system for installed software…....., etc, nothing about progress. But it surely knows about progress, because when I install the app via double clicking, the installer window that pops up shows a deterministic progress bar that progresses gradually and reaches full length when installation is complete.Any way I can capture the progress status through command line installer as well?

Sending ^ + T to a running process in Terminal will request the 'status' of that process. This is a hold-over from early BSD and is cross-compatible with most shells (bash, csh, etc.).

Sorry I did not understand you. How can I "send" `^+T` to a command in a shell script?

With [redirection](http://sc.tamu.edu/help/general/unix/redirection.html).

If you're sitting looking at a terminal waiting for something to happen, type control and T (together) on the keyboard to get its status.

After I upgrade my MacBook Pro from 10.8 to 10.14, I found the icon texts display unnormally. They are too crowd. Anybody have any solution towards this problem?<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc3GZ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/38wBK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

agent
There are likely a few things going on here. Firstly is that Apple's new default font is San Fransisco in Mojave (OS X 10.14.x) and I believe in 10.8 was Lucida Grande. So some of the text crowding you see could be caused by a different font with it's different kerning, etc.It is also possible, and judging from the screencaps you posted that some of your desktop/folder defaults were changed or reset when you did the upgrade.If you go to your desktop and select "Show view options" from the "View" menu a window will pop up allowing you to change a lot of the items that will effect what you see on your desktop. You can do the same in a Finder window but I'm sticking with the Desktop here for sake of simplicity.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6GnX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>The things you may want to fiddle with are the grid spacing and the text size.The grid spacing will move icons closer together and farther apart. So if you have long-ish file names Finder will squish the text when the icons are closer together.The text size will also affect how Finder shows file/folder names. Bigger fonts will cause the Finder to try and fit longer file names in smaller spaces (grid spacing) and squish the words/letters together. The trade-off here is that smaller font sizes can be harder to read.In your particular case I would increase the grid spacing and decrease the font size substantially and then see if things are looking better.

user
Thanks for your reply. I agree with you that it is likely the font issue. BTW, simply tweak the view option does not work.

If this is an acceptable solution please accept it as the correct answer.

Two of my USB sticks (Lexar and PNY, both 32 GB) are not getting recognized correctly by macOS Sierra. Both worked before (one formatted with NTFS, the other with FAT32); they were then used as installation media for upgrading a couple of MacBooks to macOS Sierra.They have since been tested, getting reformatted by Linux as well as Windows 7 between tests, but the following output is always the same using diskutil list:/dev/disk3 (external, physical):       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER       0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *32.0 GB    disk3       1:        Apple_partition_map                         4.1 KB     disk3s1       2:                  Apple_HFS                         311.3 KB   disk3s2After plugging them into the MacBook they are still working on Windows and Linux (they were tested by writing the whole stick and verifying the data).  I also deleted the partitions using fdisk in Linux.Is there a way to repair this behavior? And if not, is there a way I can redefine how the partitions are getting assigned by macOS so that I can still manually mount them?

agent
There's nothing wrong with what you are seeing.  That's the partition scheme for your bootable USB.  When you format it, you are not deleting the partition, just "blanking" the active partition.Formatting a partition is not the same as deleting the partition.To get back to a "single" partition (this is what I am assuming you want to do), issue this command in diskutildiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk3 1 GPT HFS+ NAME 100%This command will permanently delete anything you have on the device.  Make sure you are using the correct device identifierBe sure to replace "NAME" with the name you want to give to the USB.Your drive partition map will be wiped, and the HFS+ (Mac OS Extended) file system installed.What I suspect happened in your case is that you didn't "write" the new partition scheme to the USB.  This is done by issuing the "w" command.  <a href="https://www.linuxhelp.com/fdisk-command/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Linuxhelp</a> has an excellent tutorial on fdisk<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNLoCm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>More info can be found by typing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/diskutil.8.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">man diskutil</a>

user
Thanks! Forgot to write that I deleted the partitions using fdisk in linux and made sure there was no partition left before writing and creating a new one. I will try to add it.

agent
When you created the new partition in Linux, did you remember to *write* it to the device? It's the "w" command in `fdisk`.

user
I did write the partition table, and the changed partition table was displayed under linux but the old setup under macOS. Solved it by filling the whole stick with zeroes, including partition table. After partitioning the zeroed stick it works on all systems again, including the MacBook.

I am Looping for an iOS app supporting "document sharing" which would allow me to print to a Samba printer.Use case:open a document (e.g., a PDF) with the app (via the iOS document sharing/document picker functionality, see note below)print to a Samba printer (with authentication).An example:open the Dropbox Appchoose a PDF and click on the share buttonin the list of apps able to open a PDF there should be (among others) the printing appthe printing app should then send it to a Samba shared printerDoes such an application exist?I am looking for an iOS app able to print on an existing infrastructure, not to build an infrastructure to share a printer via AirPrint.Note: Document sharing is a feature since iOS 8 which allows application to provide documents to other apps via document picker. You can for example open Word file in the Dropbox App using the Microsoft word AppNote 2: I am not looking for a specific app for a single printer/model but a generic one supporting a Samba printer with a PS or PCL gener

agent
If you're asking whether there's an iOS app that can somehow 'see' any Samba printer and print to it, my response is that even your question states: "print to a shared Samba printer". My point here is that if it's already a shared Samba printer and its shared in a way so iOS devices can print to it, then any iOS app that can open a PDF document could do what you're wanting (i.e. Print to the Samba printer).Put another way, for an iPhone/iPad etc to print to a Samba printer it must be able to 'see' the printer first. So, unless it's one that supports AirPrint natively, you'd need to use some software to make it visible to iOS devices. There's quite a few options out there (e.g. <a href="http://www.netputing.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.netputing.com</a>) that people can use to make their shared printers visible to iOS devices.Otherwise, as far as I know there is no iOS app out there that can print to a Samba printer that it can't actually see.I hope this helps, one way or another.

user
There is no need to see the printer with an automatic discovery. It can be configured knowing the address of the server sharing it. As usual on a desktop machineAnd my question does not mention a "shared samba printer". An app supporting their document sharing API from iOS printing to a Samba printer

agent
Okay, maybe you could revise your question to be more specific, as it's currently open to interpretation. And, with due respect, your second bullet point does refer to printing to a shared printer.

Yes, but a samba printer is shared by definition.I edited the question

I need to be able to SSH into a Mac (Mountain Lion) and check if ARD is running and if so, what are the settings. Basically, I need the equivalent of going to System Preferences -> Sharing -> Remote Management and visually inspecting the options set there. But I need it on the Terminal so I can do this via SSH.Note, I am not asking how to set these options (e.g. through the ARD "kickstart" executable), I am asking how, once it is running, to determine what options it is running under.ps -axlww | grep ARD shows only /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent without any flags shown.Is there a plist file where this is stored? So far I've checked .../Library/Preferences/com.apple.ARDAgent.plist/Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement.plist... and similar files within the user's ~/Library/Preferences/ directory, and they do not seem to contain anything useful.

agent
I have a possible solution for you, I say 'possible' because it's not very reliable (<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93567/system-preferences-applescript-using-osascript-cannot-select-its-window">I submitted a question on it earlier</a>).One other thing, you'll have to "Enable access for assistive devices", I don't know why.  So here's the AppleScript:tell application "System Preferences"        reveal pane "com.apple.preferences.sharing"end telltell application "System Events"        set SSCBrow to 2        -- Set to the row corresponding to Screen Sharing        tell process "System Preferences"                set screen_sharing_toggle to value of (checkbox 1 of row SSCBrow of table 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window 1) as boolean        end tellend telltell application "System Preferences"        Quitend tellset newvar to screen_sharing_toggleIf you save that as, say, checkScrShr you can run it from the command line as:osascript checkScrShrIt will echo 'true' if Screen Sharing is enabled, 'false' if it isn't.

user
By "unreliable", do you mean that there are intermittent failures of the script?

agent
That's right: It will either tell you correctly whether or not Screen Sharing is running, or it will return an error.  One other thing: the script says row 2, make sure row 2 is where your Screen Sharing is in the Sharing pane.@Dave I've updated the code so it's clearer

user
Thanks. My experience is that there is a general issue with OS X's new security model and AppleScript. Depending on conditions outside of the Terminal environment, an AppleScript may or may not run correctly, falsely complaining about syntax errors and whatnot. Poor release engineering on Apple's part and I still haven't found a solution.Going back to the main issue, though, I'm looking more for a way to determine not just that it is running, but what configuration it is running with. Thanks for your AppleScript example, however, it might provide a lead.

alright, great. Thanks for the answer.. so is there actually a way to 'fool' the app that I am using a different phone? I already tried changing my MAC address, my UDID and my app store user account..

agent
@Mike It depends entirely on which method the app is using. It could even be obtaining your Game Center username and using that! If your device is jailbroken, you may be able to override the method that determines the unique identifier with a tweak such as Flex.

user
thanks for the tip. I tried Flex 2, but it doesn't have any options for the McDonald's app. I guess I'll just leave it alone then... but I don't like when technology wins over me :D

I just finished downloading my copy of Lion and wanted to install it on a new second partition. I freed up just over 50 GBs from my hard drive and am now stuck trying to shrink my existing partition. I'm using the Disk Utility, but am continually getting:  Partition failed    Partition failed with the error:    The partition cannot be resized. Try  reducing the amount of change in the  size of the partition.I've tried just resizing by 1 gigabyte and it still fails. Any free tools to fix this? Thanks.

When I ran into this problem, I used <a href="http://www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag.php" rel="nofollow">iDefrag</a> to defragment the volume, and that let me shrink it.  Unfortunately it's not free.It has since occurred to me that it might work better to dismount the partition before shrinking.  If you want to try this, you'll need to boot from something else, like your O S X install DVD.

Thanks Gordon. I've heard of iDefrag but don't really want to spend the $30.

Kevin: I know, it'd be a perfectly reasonable price -- if you were going to use it more than once.  I'l add some ideas to my second option: empty trash, boot from DVD, open Terminal, clear out /Volumes/yourvol/private/var/vm, .../var/tmp, .../var/folders, and .../tmp (but don't delete any of the folders themselves); THEN try shrinking it.

My father created a family membership for apple music, and I created an apple account (icloud.com) for that purpose (I'm in the family group).I'm trying to login from the Apple Music Android app, and keep getting The code you entered is not valid. Try again. in the account review part.What should I do to set it up correctly? It's a new account, I've never used Apple services before and I also don't have any products except this membership. Should I login to an Apple device, download iTunes for my PC, or anything else? What am I missing?2018 Update: After more than a year, I still haven't got a response from the customer support. It won't happen ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

agent
An Apple Music Family Membership requires iCloud Family Sharing to be set up.According to Apple:  Family Sharing requires a personal Apple ID signed in to iCloud and iTunes. Music, movies, TV shows and books can be downloaded on up to 10 devices per account, five of which can be computers. iOS 8 or later and OS X Yosemite or later are required to set up or join a Family Sharing group, and are recommended for full functionality. Not all content is eligible for Family Sharing. Content can be hidden by family members; hidden content is not available for download. Content downloaded from family members or acquired via redemption codes is not subject to Ask to Buy.    iCloud requires iOS 5 or later on iPhone 3Gs or later, iPod touch (3rd  generation or later), iPad Pro, iPad Air or later, iPad or later, or  iPad mini or later; a Mac computer with OS X Lion 10.7.5 or later; or  a PC with Windows 7 or Windows 8 (Outlook 2007 or later or an  up-to-date browser is required for accessing email, contacts and  calendars). Some features require iOS 10 and macOS Sierra. Some  features require a Wi-Fi connection. Some features are not available  in all countries. Access to some services is limited to 10 devices.Since you're saying you're already in the family group, I expect the problem you're having is that you're using an Android device (the above seems to imply you need to be on macOS, iOS or Windows). I would do the following:Contact Apple to check if there is a way around this conundrum and, if not,Send <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/apple-music.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">feedback</a> to Apple as well as an email to support@apple.com (that's the email address they use for support re their Android apps).I would think that since Apple offers the Apple Music Android app that this is an unintended consequence of how things are currently set up, so sending feedback is the only way of getting things changed.

user
Thanks for detailed your reply! I've just installed iTunes on windows and tried to connect with it, and also tried to login to an iPhone 5 device - but I'm still getting the message `The code you entered is not valid` from both iTunes on windows and iPhone 5. The message is received in the `Review Your Address` section in the login processI'll try sending them an email, and post and update later

agent
Just had a thought - are you and your dad by any chance in different countries? Or, more to the point, have iTunes accounts for different iTunes stores? If so that would explain the issue - a family group has to belong to the same iTunes Store (i.e. country). If not, it'll be interesting to see what response you get. It may also be worth contacting Apple Support by phone - you'll probably get a faster resolution that way.

user
Interesting, although we are in the same country, but I have no idea how to account is set. I've sent them an email, lets see what they say about it!I tried to create an apple id with my gmail account, and now everything works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

(Apple haven't responded yet). I think that this time I finished the review process before joining the family group - Created the account, logged in from iTunes on windows and only then joined the family sharing

agent
Well, when you have the time it may be worth adding an _answer_ to that effect as it's most likely the solution to your problem and may help others. Although you could wait a while to see what Apple says when they respond, in case it's also worth adding to your answer.

Homebrew had the same problem you had when you tried to download iTerm2 directly from its website - I imagine the website was temporarily offline (it seems to be OK now - I've just downloaded iTerm2 successfully).I'd suggest trying again. If it still doesn't work, check the website on <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/iterm2.com" rel="noreferrer">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a>, and wait until the website is back up.

In that case, I think the problem may be at your end (or between you and iTerm.com) - I've just re-downloaded iTerm2 and it worked OK the second time as well. You could try checking with your ISP - mention that ordinary web browsing works OK, and that you checked on downforeveryoneorjustme.com and the site is up, but you still can't reach it.

I forward my university email address to my GMail account, so I don’t have my university IMAP set up as an account on my iPad (and I don’t want to, because then I’d receive those mails twice). Still, I want to send email using that address, via my university’s SMTP server.Is there any way to add another sender address to an account and assign it a different SMTP server than the account’s default SMTP in the iPad’s email client?If not, can you recommend another email client for the iPad that has this capability?

agent
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4519" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Configuring additional outgoing mail servers</a>from the Apple support websites has detail instructions:Go to Settings &#x2192; Mail, Contacts, Calendars.Tap the Mail account for which you would like to change the settings.If your account is configured to sync Notes or other items, you may need to tap Account Info on the following screen as well.On the Account Info screen, locate the Outgoing Mail Server section and tap the existing SMTP entry.A list of SMTP servers will appear, with the Primary Server and then Other SMTP Servers. Go to Other SMTP servers &#x2192; Add Server....Enter the additional SMTP server information. Host Name is required. Tap Save.

user
Yes, but that page does not explain how to assign the server to an address. It sounds more like “if the default SMTP is down/unreachable, it will try to use the other one instead”. What I want is to always use it for mails I send from one specific address (and always use the default server for the primary address).

agent
Whenever you compose a new mail, you may choose from which server/address to send it from by tapping on "From:".

user
That popup menu only shows addresses for me, not servers.

agent
@Lukas Each email address is bound to a server in the Mail app.

user
And how does that binding work? I can add new email addresses (by entering them comma-separated into the account’s Email field) and new SMTP servers (via the method you described) independently from each other. Also, if I send an email from my university address with the university’s SMTP server set up via that method, it still uses GMail’s SMTP server (according to the mail headers).

agent
@Lukas If you send mail from a different SMTP server, the receiver of your mail can only see the email address related to this email service. If you just change the name of the address (comma solution), the mail is not sent via a different server. Several mail clients (e.g. Outlook) will be able to see both your email addresses: The one related to the SMTP server and the alias. Apple's mail client only shows the alias - i think. In general it's better to send emails using different servers, not just alias.

user
Yes, and I want to send email using a different server – I just don’t see any way to do that without setting up a completely separate email account (the method you linked to above only adds a new SMTP as a backup for the default one and doesn’t allow to specify an email address for use with that server). GMail’s web interface and Sparrow, for example, allow this (using their Send Email As/Alias features and then setting a custom SMTP for an address), but I guess Apple’s client doesn’t.  Anyway, thanks for trying to help, appreciate it. :)

I have a directory of AVI files that I would like to combine into a single AVI file.  These AVI files come from a dash cam and have two video tracks -- a front camera and a rear camera.I tried to use the suggestion <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/114780/19830">here</a> to combine the videos.  Specifically:ffmpeg -f concat -i &lt;(for f in $PWD/*.avi;do echo "file '$f'";done) -c copy output.aviThis works great for the first (front) video track but completely removes the second (rear) video track.How can I concatenate these files and retain both video tracks?  Alternatively, is there a way I can specify the video track to concatenate?

agent
Basically what you need to do is demultiplex each file, then concatenate the resulting files. There is a way to do this with the <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate#filter" rel="nofollow">concat filter</a>, but it requires re-encoding everything as it goes.So you need to do two operations. First, demultiplex. (Note this is untested with ffmpeg, as I don't have any video files to test with, but should theoretically work.)I=0;J=1;for f in $PWD/*.avi;do ffmpeg -i "$f" -map 0:v:0 -codec copy output$I.avi -map 0:v:1 -codec copy output$J.avi &amp;&amp; I=$(($I+1)) &amp;&amp; J=$(($J+1));doneThen you can use the concat demuxer as usual:ffmpeg -f concat -i &lt;(for f in $PWD/*.avi;do echo "file '$f'";done) -c copy output.avi

user
This worked great.  The only change I made is: I=0;J=1;for f in $PWD/*.avi;do ffmpeg -i "$f" -map 0:v:0 -codec copy front$I.avi -map 0:v:1 -codec copy back$J.avi && I=$(($I+1)) && J=$(($J+1));done  and then a corresponding filename change to the concatenation command.  I'd edit, but I don't have the necessary reputation.  Thanks!

agent
If you do that, you can lose `J=1;` and `J=$(($J+1));` and change `back$J.avi` to `back$I.avi` - with different output filenames, the number can be the same for both.

Right.  Nice simplification.

There are a few devices I found that have been recently added to the market<a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=103887&amp;ra=true" rel="nofollow">Garmin Ant+ adaptor for iPhone</a><a href="http://www.wahoofitness.com/Products/Wahoo-Fitness-Wahoo-Key-for-iPhone.asp" rel="nofollow">Wahoo Key for iPhone</a>Both allow you to connect and record in real time exercise data in association with their and other third party apps (<a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=104231" rel="nofollow">Garmin Fit</a> and Wahoo have a list <a href="http://www.wahoofitness.com/Apps/Apps.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>)What I have not been able to confirm is whether it will provide upload facility from devices after being out of range as you want. My assumption is yes it can, since you can get swim watch data entry.All the products were originally designed for iPhone and I don't see any issue with running them on an ipad

user
I presume the app or website I want to upload the data to would need to support input/upload via the app or via iPad Safari though?

agent
that would entirely depend on the app used.  I suggest you research the apps and the dongles a bit more to ensure that this is a valid answer, but it's a little outside of the Ask Different remit

user
I think I'll take a look at the two suggested dongles and maybe post in the Endomondo and Runkeeper forums too. Thanks.

I'm thinking about updating a bit my Macbook Pro mid 2010 adding to it 8Gb of RAM and maybe a new hard drive, a solid one (SSD) of probably 240Gb.Which SSD would you recommend me? I'm looking for one compatible with TRIM because as far as I know that's the best way to go in order to keep the performance of the SSD after some time.I've also checked <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/09/revisiting-solid-state-hard-drives.html" rel="nofollow">some performances reviews</a> and it seems there's a big difference between some of them. (or there was, as the article is from 2010)I was checking the models Apple used in its days for the firsts Macbook Pro with SSD, but I believe there are better options now in the market.Is it relevant that my laptop is from 2010? Should I take that into account for something?I believe I shouldn't experiment any problem with this change of hard drive and will improve the laptop performance as well as the hard drive life. Am I wrong?I'm afraid of the possibility of having problems with it for compatibility issues or any other thing.Thanks!

agent
I recommend the Crucial M500 SSDs. They're solid, reliable, and fast. I've replaced the OEM HDD on both my 2008 aluminum MacBook and 2011 MacBook Pro with them and have had 0 issues so far, they work great. Below are some links for your perusal.<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00BQ8RHJ2" rel="nofollow">Buy them on Amazon</a><a href="http://www.crucial.com/store/ProductMarketing_m500.aspx" rel="nofollow">Manufacturer Information</a>

Some other people is recommending me the Samsung 840.Here's a comparison: http://ssd.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Samsung-840-Pro-256GB-vs-Crucial-M500-240GB/1408vs1551

I can only honestly recommend what I've used and can vouch for :) Crucial has also been in the SSD/memory business/market longer than Samsung has, btw.

user
you are right. I also checked it in an [Apple discussions topic](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5445008?start=00&tstart=0) and it seems the controllers of the Crucial M500 are much better for a Mac computer.

How do I know if an update requires restart in macOS Sierra? I just updated iTunes and read the description of the update, but couldn't find any mention of a restart required. After a moment the computer restarted without a warning. Luckily, I wasn't in the middle of anything important, but I'd like to avoid such forced restarts in the future.Edit: There was also a macOS Sierra update today. In the figure below, there's no mention of a restart required. I also followed the two links, but found no mention there either. I'm pretty sure that the info shown here was the same prior to the update.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZTAjD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

agent
When you look at the Updates list in the Mac App Store, it will indicate in the info if a restart is required. Below is an example of this:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfEeA.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>You will see the words Restart Required followed by an icon of a white triangle within a grey circle (looks like a reverse play button).Prior to installing the update, just check the info against each update to see whether any of them require a restart.Security updates and OS updates usually require a restart. Most other apps don't.

user
Thanks for your answer, but I've edited my question and provided a counterexample. I was expecting a restart, of course, ensuing a system update.

agent
Yes, but the screenshot you've added to your question was taken of the update **after** it was installed. This will no longer indicate that a restart was required. The indication of a restart being required is only present _before_ you install it. In addition, I also know that sometimes people click on Update All (in the case of multiple updates) and get caught out because one of them required a restart. So you really do need to check all of them if choosing to install multiple updates simultaneously. I've updated my answer to show you an example.

user
Prior to the update I really tried to find a notification of a restart, but I guess I somehow managed to miss that. Well, thank you anyway! Now I know where to look in the future.

This Macbook Pro (15" circa 2012) is giving me trouble. After a slight water spill incident, I removed and replaced the hard drive, optical drive and battery (warning sticker ignored). After another day drying I turned it on. However, the battery is not recognised, everything's happening slower and the mouse is really jumpy. I've also noticed the CPU load from the Activity Monitor remains steady at 80%-90% for the System (kernel_task). I'd like to reset the SMC to see what happens, but it doesn't seem to be resetting. The PRAM/NVRAM reset is working, just not the SMC reset (I'm using shift-control-option + power). Is there another way to do the SMC reset? Maybe open it up and poke around some more?

agent
In the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295" rel="nofollow">Apple Support article on SMC reset</a> it reads "On MagSafe power adapters, the LED might change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.". Other than that SMC reset does nothing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7lSJzQ8H9U" rel="nofollow">visible</a>. So probably the reset is working.It seems like the battery is dead. In that case the Mac will throttle the CPU to reduce power consumption. This explains also the high load. Since the battery is necessary to buffers peak loads, the MacBook relies on it to operate properly.You must replace your battery.

user
I'm just hesitant replacing the battery, when there might be other things going on, and the whole thing is a write-off. I was hoping a SMC reset might reveal more.Tried a new battery.  Same issue.

agent
@Shane Sorry to hear...That probably means the logic board is damaged :(@Shane You can run Apple diagnostics by pressing D at startup. But anyway you will have to bring it in.

user
I've run diagnostics and it says nothing's wrong. On the board I notice some salty calcification between the (i 625 9AHRTZ) and the (f DCO8A FDMS 0349) components.  Tried dabbing it with methylated spirits, but that didn't do anything.Turns out the i625 9AHRTZ is the Intersil battery charger controller and if it's fried, it won't easily be refitted.  But a short near here does make sense.  I've already shifted onto a new device, so I won't be spending any more money on this one.  In the meantime I'll look into board cleaning methods.

System Software Overview:  System Version:   macOS 10.13.6 (17G3025)  Kernel Version:   Darwin 17.7.0I would like to capture only the content of a window, without the menu. In other words, I would like to capture this:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SnPYP.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>instead than this:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uFF8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>I can use Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4 and then resize the capture area to just the contents of the window, but that's not very convenient...isn't there a shortcut which doesn't involve selecting areas with the mouse?

agent
I'm not sure how convenient this would be for your workflow...Switch to fullscreen.From the View menu, uncheck "Always show toolbar in full screen"Use  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4  then tap the spacebar &amp; click in the windowThis will [as always] take a snap of the entire window - but in this case it will leave out the toolbar entirely.Scrollbars will hide or show depending on your setting in System Prefs > General<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jjHmd.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
hmmm...good idea, forcing the window to be fullscreen sometimes makes the resulting image too small to be readable. Let's see if someone else has an alternative idea.

agent
How does it make it too small?... it's the size of your screen. Any bigger & it wouldn't fit.. the image I posted, btw, was resized before upload; the original is 2560x1440

user
There's a misunderstanding here: I mean that, if I have to enlarge the window to fullscreen before capturing the screen, then the result image is very large with respect to the characters (but still readable, because I have a high resolution monitor). **However**, I then have to resize the image to a smaller size if I want to put it in a document or an email, and at this point, the characters become quite small. Anyway, even if it's not ideal, this procedure answers my question, thus I'm accepting it.

I'm running a setup with the latest Retina MacBook Pro, a Windows desktop and a single external monitor. Both machines are outputting display to a HDMI switcher, which connects to the monitor. I can switch between the sources with a button on the switcher.The problem is that everytime I switch to the Windows machine, the Mac goes to sleep since it's in clamshell mode and it has no display connected. The VPN connection I use for work on the Mac keeps disconnecting because the machine goes to sleep.I've tried fiddling with the power saving settings and other third party programs (including Caffeine and NoSleep) that are supposed to keep the machine awake, but none worked so far.I am running Mavericks 10.9.5 on the latest MacBook Pro model (SSD).Any ideas on how to always keep the machine awake, even when I switch the display to the Windows desktop?

agent
<a href="http://semaja2.net/projects/insomniaxinfo/" rel="nofollow">InsomniaX</a> is a third party program designed to do just that: disabling the sleep mode on a Apple laptops.The program can prevent the Mac entering sleep mode from closing the lid or just idling (or both, of course). It's also possible to disable the sleep mode as per timer, after which the sleep mode kicks in normally.

user
Hi, InsomniaX doesn't seem to work either. The machine seems to be awake, but the VPN client thinks it's not. It disconnects the session because it thinks the machine has been suspended. Would it behave like that because when I switch displays from the Mac > Windows (and back), OS X is temporarily suspending while it detects the display changes?

agent
Hmm, could be. Are there any retry-options in the VPN? Which VPN are you using?

user
I am using the Cisco AnyConnect client. Reconnection is disabled on the VPN server, so I have no control over it.

I have an app in the app store and I'm trying to link to it on my webpage.  I've got the link working on any standard browser, but when I open the website in WeChat and use the link, it does nothing.  This problem is not occuring on my Android device, only on iOS.  So I think what's happening is iOS thinks that the link is an ad and won't allow the page to open the app store.I've tried just plain old <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/appname" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.com/apps/appname</a>, but this seems to attempt a redirect as well.So is there a way to link a user to the app store without opening the app-store app?

agent
I prefer smart app banners for the best mobile safari experience.Have a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html</a>Basically you insert code in the header area:&lt;meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=myAppStoreID, affiliate-data=myAffiliateData, app-argument=myURL"&gt;

user
The problem is that this is opening inside WeChat's browser.  Would clicking this banner send them to the app store or through the browser?

agent
@Csteele5 Good luck using web view in WeChat. Your banner renders on iOS 9 but not on iOS 8.4 for me, but the sites are slow to render at the moment. I'd put the download link on all safari / desktop or not, but that's your call. The URL should get intercepted by mobile safari and dump the user into the App Store app on iOS (and that's what I'm seeing)

user
Right, but in the WeChat browser it pretty much blocks any attempts to go to iTunes or the app store. I wonder if it thinks it's an ad or something. Have you had problems using WeChat Web view before?

I am looking to get the new 12″ MacBook and as a result I would like to know the clock speed (in GHz) my current MacBook Air (late 2010) is running at so I know the processor on the MacBook will cope.At the moment I know my processor running at the lowest frequency is 1.86GHz (as shown in System Information) and when I look in Activity Monitor as suggested <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103237/how-to-monitor-cpu-core-usage">here</a> it only shows me the CPU usage and not the current clock speed. I have also looked at <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1270/can-i-see-my-cpu-and-memory-usage-meters-in-the-menu-bar">this</a> suggestion but again it does not show me my processing frequency.The reason why I want to find out the current speed my MacBook Air is running at is because Turbo Charge (explained <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/176269/112840">here</a>) can have it's clock run at various speeds from moment to moment. I have also tried Intel's power gadget software as suggested by @grgarside however my Air's CPU is not supported as shown here.

agent
There may be a way to view your CPU's clock speed at this exact second, but as mentioned elsewhere, it is a constantly changing variable (due to Turbo Charge). Comparing clock speeds between different CPU generations, especially nearly five years apart, is also not at all useful.A much more useful approach would be to use benchmarks. MacWorld uses Speedmark 8 to test most (if not all) Mac models that are produced, and there is a list <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2082044/how-we-test-speedmark-9-mac-benchmarks.html?page=4" rel="nofollow">here</a> of the results. They "take the performance results from the 15 individual tests that make up Speedmark and boil them down to a single number", resulting in an easily-compared list which reviews multiple facets of the computer (not just the CPU). That list does not yet have the new MacBook models on it, but it likely will soon.You can also compare scores on the GeekBench browser, which directly measure the CPU's performance. Your model's benchmarks are <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench3/search?dir=desc&amp;q=model%3A%22MacBook+Air+%28Late+2010%29%22+frequency%3A1860&amp;sort=multicore_score" rel="nofollow">here</a> and average about 1950. The Core M-5Y70 processor, which powers the new MacBook, is available at 1.1 GHz, 1.2 GHz, or 1.3 GHz. The only benchmarks currently available are for the <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench3/search?dir=desc&amp;q=Intel+Core+M+5Y70&amp;sort=multicore_score" rel="nofollow">1.3 GHz version of the CPU</a>, and the score for that averages about two times higher than your model's score. (Hence why the clock speed is irrelevant when comparing different generations of CPUs.)A score of two times higher on GeekBench indicates two times the performance. Even accounting for the slower base models at 1.1 GHz and 1.2 GHz, performance will still be significantly increased versus your existing MacBook Air.

user
Thank you for your informative answer. Are you meaning the new Core-M processor is more powerful then my MacBook air 2010 processor?!?

agent
Yes as stated above, up to four times more powerful, depending on the clock speed.

user
So does this mean that if the MacBook Air 2010 does me fine then the new MacBook should cope with what I want it to do?

agent
Correct. ------

KeyboardViewer app is saved from this AppleScript.on run {input, parameters}    if application "KeyboardViewer" is running then        quit application "KeyboardViewer"    else         activate application "KeyboardViewer"    end if    return inputend runDock toggle save. Adding shortcut to above, needs some work... Syntax error Can’t set application "KeyboardViewer" to some object. Access not allowed.tell application "System Events"    set application "KeyboardViewer" to (keystroke "K" using control down)end tell

agent
If you're wanting to assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript application, you'll need to do it as an Automator Service. However, one of the issues you'll run into, when Keyboard Viewer has focus is, it will eat the keyboard shortcut and not close Keyboard Viewer. You'd have to set focus away from Keyboard Viewer in order for the Automator Service to close Keyboard Viewer.The following AppleScript code does that, providing you have not set focus to it after it opens or reset it elsewhere if you did.on run    tell application "System Events"        set activeApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true and visible is true    end tell    if application "KeyboardViewer" is running then        quit application "KeyboardViewer"    else        activate application "KeyboardViewer"    end if    tell application activeApp to activateend runIn Automator create a new Service workflow with the following setting:Service receives no input in any applicationAdd a Run AppleScript action.Replace the default code with the code above.Click the Compile button (Hammer icon).Save it as e.g.: Toggle Keyboard ViewerIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Services > Shortcuts > ServicesFind e.g. Toggle Keyboard Viewer and give it a shortcut.I gave it: ⌥⌘KNote: Finding a keyboard shortcut that isn't already taken by another app can be a challenge. In this use case, any application that has focus when e.g. ⌥⌘K is pressed, it will go to the app's assigned command before it goes to the e.g.: Toggle Keyboard Viewer service. You might need to go to a four key keyboard shortcut, e.g.: ^⌥⌘K<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tZ6Xo.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UsQY.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
I did try Services approach, but shortcut was ignored. Then tried same application-and-services approaches, using launchd keyboardservicesd, same result. Perhaps an if-else, but then if-else cannot handle keystroke assignment (syntax good but system cannot parse). Nulaana Shortcuts FAQ https://www.nulana.com/support/ - tell application "System Events" delay 0.5keystroke "n" using {command down, control down} end tellNulana's Delay 0.5 works, keystroke seated in Dock's toggle icon application but... Now we have problem KeyboardViewer is open, and app just highlights shortcut keys, intercepting and cutting off any application-services shortcut settings. I think this effort needs to inject something more into launchd. Btw, instructions above very well done.

agent
@mark stewart, What I posted works, I would not have posted it otherwise! Saying "I did try Services approach, but shortcut was ignored." is on no value without knowing what keyboard shortcut you assigned. Did you read my **Note:** in my answer? If the keyboard shortcut you assigned was done by the code you show in the OP, i.e. `tell application "System Events" set application "KeyboardViewer" to (keystroke "K" using control down)` You cannot assign a keyboard shortcut in that manned, it's improper coding regardless of the fact that it compiles. Read the first part of my answer up to the code.

user
Sorry, copy and paste what works for you, not working here, just an error beep. Put this to Nulana support, as sending new mail with other apps open blocks Nulana too. Nulana opens my old Lion Gem, but sometimes close just displays keypress. Launchd (500), for Sierra 10.12.6. Wonder what happens to keyboardservicesd in High Sierra? Flakey applet. Maybe certain Accessibility features make KeyboardViewer.app more stable? Feedback to Apple, requesting more robust app... Got to be careful here, new mp6,1 may be replaced soon.user3439894 wrote: "is on no value without knowing what keyboard shortcut you assigned"user3439894 ... I followed your post, not working here. Nulana Shortcuts.app does work without too many apps running. Maybe ELSE could be used to make your version an IF against my sweet and simple. So IF my version does not close THEN your version would. Nice thing about just using a Dock shortcut to my Automator KeyView.app is that in Keyboard preferences any shortcut used may interfere less with Mac global shortcuts.

Last year I installed Ubuntu on my 2006 MacBook (Intel), and erased the hard drive with MacOSX 10.5 in the process. Linux was fun, but now I want another Mac to play around with.I've put 10.8's install files on a flash drive and rebooted (holding option), but this brings up the Linux drive selector, and I do not see my flash drive as an option.How can I go about installing 10.9 on my MacBook?Update: I've now got 10.8 on my flash drive. When I load Startup Manager, I see 3 options:Windows, which actually takes me to Ubuntu.EFI Boot which produces a "no" symbol and then the computer shuts down.rEFItI've got rEFIt running through my optical drive. When I select this, I get three primary choices:Boot Mac OSX from Mac OSX Install ESD: "no" symbolBoot boot.efi from Mac OS X Install ESD: "no" symbolBoot Linux from HD: Linux boots as normal.

You can't install Mavericks on a 2006 MacBook.  To install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:      iMac (Mid-2007 or later)  MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later)  MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later),  MacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)  MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)  Mac mini (Early 2009 or later)  Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later)  Xserve (Early 2009)  Source: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5842" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5842</a>

@gmacfarlane What method did you use to put the 'install files' on your flash drive? It should have seen the drive, but not been able to boot from it.

I used Disk Utility to execute the instructions here: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-to-install-os-x-mavericks/I used this same flash drive to do a clean install on a 2012 MacBook Pro two weeks ago.

agent
@gmacfarlane Indeed, it should have seen the drive with the ⌥-boot. C-boot won't boot from a USB. Holding a key on boot intercepts the boot at firmware level and shouldn't have any impact on the OS that is installed. It'll even work if you don't have an OS installed.

Correct.  Assuming you want to put Ethernet 2 as priority over Ethernet 1 and then change them back.  I suggest putting the services in quotes to handle the spaces.

user
You're my hero allan, thank you.  I'll try to work that out and get back to this :)Allan, I messed around with it a little bit.  Changed the names to make it easier.  Using networksetup -ordernetworkservices "Public" "Ethernet" "Wi-fi" so that I'm on my outside internet, and networksetup -ordernetworkservices "Ethernet" "Public" "Wi-fi" to get back to my work ethernet.

I have an old Canon CanoScan FS4000US Slide Scanner. I have connected it via USB to an Intel iMac running Mac OS 10.7.5, and in System Report, I can see that it is connected. Also, when I disconnect and reconnect the USB cable, the slide tray ejects on the scanner. What I would like to know is if there is any way to mount the scanner properly as a device so that it will be available in Image Capture. I downloaded VueScan, a third-party software, that is able to see the device and process a scan, so there must be some way to get the drivers to see the device in Image Capture. Any ideas?

agent
Have you tried installing this <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL56" rel="nofollow">comprehensive Apple Canon Printer/Scanner driver set</a>?I dont have an FS400US I can test this with but its worth a shot.

user
For whatever reason, I am not able to install this. "Canon Printer Drivers can't be installed on this disk. The volume does not meet the requirements for this update."

agent
Have you done all the supplemental system updates through system update? Seems like that error throws when there is a model specific update that hasn't been performed.

user
Software Update says everything is up to date. I found a newer version of the Canon Printer Driver download, but it hasn't helped either.

How can I play a .ogg music file on the command line? On Linux I can use <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ogg1231.html" rel="nofollow">ogg123</a>, but what about on Mac?

agent
You can still use ogg123 through the <a href="https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/audio/vorbis-tools/Portfile" rel="nofollow">The Ogg Vorbis CODEC tools</a>, installed through the <a href="http://www.macports.org" rel="nofollow">MacPorts Project.</a>

It's seems good, i installed the vorbis-tools so how i play now? afplay not play and have no command ogg123.

agent
On the first link I give you says that there's a configuration argument which is: `--enable-ogg123`. I guess you'll need to use it.

user
understood :), i dont know the macports very well, i try pass the argument like as follow: "sudo port install vorbis-tools configure.args=--enable-ogg123" but dont works, its correctly?

I was wondering,is it possible to allow for simple latex formatting on iMessage?At least for just greek letters, it shouldn't be too different from the emoticons support.

A dirty solution: use LaTeXiT (<a href="http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit/latexit-home.php?lang=en" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit/latexit-home.php?lang=en</a>), simply type whatever you need to write into iMessage there, then copy the result as an image and paste it into iMessage.

There should actually be a "service" (Appname Menu->Services->...) which *should* let you TeXify anything that you write, but I never figured out how this works, if you ever manage, let me know ;-)http://cl.ly/image/462t16273Y1r/Image%202015-02-09%20at%207.01.06%20PM.png

I've read some other topics about not needed firewall for iPad's, but I'm searching the other way of security or (more important) to help my budget.I need firewall that has incoming/outcoming rules for every app. Rules should be remembered and asked only once, but easily to change. Good would be having profiles which I could switch when needed.Is something like this available for iPad? Is it working without Jailbreak?P.S. It should block apple services too when I want to.

It took me 3 months to ID3 Tag all of the MP3s (artist, album, released year, etc) in my iTunes library.  It was annoying.  I saw that Winamp solves this problem with an "Auto Tag" feature.  Is there a plugin for iTunes on OS X to do the same? Or does iTunes itself support this?P.S: I would like the program or plugin or whatever else to be compatible with iTunes.

agent
iTunes does have a "Get Track Names" option under the "Advanced" menu. That should be what you're looking for. Granted it might not find everything, but it finds most of them.If you aren't ripping from a CD, then I suggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEatBrainz" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iEatBrainz</a>, though you will have to scrum up a UB for it.Other software:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaikoz" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jaikoz</a> (Java)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicBrainz_Picard" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MusicBrainz Picard</a> (Python)<a href="http://6v8.gamboni.org/IEatBrainz-Universal-Build.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iEatBrainZ UB</a>

this option just work when you RIP the CD but when you download MP3 this option doesn't work. then it's not a proper answer for me:(

@Am1rr: Ah, I thought these were from CD. Second option: [iEatBrainz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEatBrainz), though that comes with issues like not having an "official" UB.

+1 for your answer and if can't find better one I accept this in future.I must add some note about your answer:1-iEastBraind was not supprted in futur and developer leave the project but maybe in future they put the source of code in sourceforge.2-Jaikoz was not free :(3- except iEatBrainz other application you suggest was not compatible and work with iTunes :(

I'm not sure what's going on, but suddenly I can't open Preferences in Safari. Nothing happens at all.This might have to do with the fact that I installed Safari 12, then realized I couldn't downgrade, so I manually removed Safari 12 (after disabling SIP) via sudo rm -rf /Applications/Safari.app, then restored Safari 11 via Time Machine.It works in every other way, except Preferences.

agent
I would be willing to bet that Safari 11 can't read the Safari 12 preferences file(s). No doubt part of the upgrade process is to make changes to these files to reflect the differences between the two versions.Of course Apple is not going to tell you about this because going back to an earlier version who would do that? (GASP!)You are probably have to play the preferences dance, eg start removing preferences files associated with Safari until it starts working again on your Mac.Open a Finder window, hold down Option and go to the "Go" Menu and select Library. In that folder find Preferences and then look for things that start with "Com.Apple.Safari" on my Mac it looks like this.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IssrL.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>It could be a little different on your Mac any one (or all) of these files could be unreadable by your version of Safari. So quit the app, move one of these to the desktop and relaunch Safari, until it works.More bad news: there is also a "Safari" folder in Library, any one or more of these files could also be a problem. SO you may have to repeat that routine again with the files in there.

user
Sadly, even after moving all the aforementioned files, preferences in Safari still won't open.

agent
then it is likely that installing the newer version of Safari changed something in WebKit (or the like...) deep in the system. So reverting is going to mean backing up your files and wiping and reinstalling the OS

Ugh. What a royal pain.

Reading related posts it seems I have a blend of other's issues.  But the final blow was plugging in a nextbook tablet to download some pdf files, and THEN I booted the old Mac Pro 2008 with Yosemite 10.10.3 or 4, can't recall exactly now since I can't check it.  I 'assume' having the tablet plugged in on boot confused the boot up sequence?I've tried every startup key configuration in the official Apple list, except trying the few 'over the internet' options i.e. 'Option-D: Apple Hardware Test/Apple Diagnostics over the internet,' 'Command-Option-B Start up from OS X Recovery over the internet,' because my hardwired modem is on the computer I'm using to get help.  I'll power this down and try it now, but if that doesn't work, which isn't likely, it's still in White Screen Hang.  It was also black screen crashing before this and restarting over and over, intermittently... if that may be contributing to this issue.  Thanks.

agent
Already tried NVRAM reset? I've been surprised by how many problems this "fixes":<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063" rel="nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063</a>  Turn on your Mac.     Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.     Hold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time.     Release the keys.

user
Thank you, Jaime Santa Cruz.  Yes, I did, but I think I did it incorrectly re: the holding and sounds.  I'll be able to try this again Wednesday, and I'll RSVP.  Thank you so much!Jaime Santa Cruz:  I was able to get to this tonight and unfortunately it didn't work.  I did it twice, just to make sure, and the 2nd time, the HD started whirring way fast/loud, so I power button powered down before it blew.  It had done this for me a couple+ times before when I was trying different things.  So, I'm still getting the Apple logo, progress bar goes about 1/4 to 1/3 across, then stops, white screen, with the pointer up in the upper left corner.  Any idea why plugging in a nextbook tablet would do that?  Seller told me I could download pdf files from my Mac.  ?  Thanks.

agent
gah, formatting fail....let's try that again...Had to go find the site again, but I thought I remembered there being offline diagnostics options:(from https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255 )**Shift**  _Start up in Safe Mode._                        **D**  _Start up to either Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics, depending on which Mac you're using._                 **Command-R**  _Start up from OS X Recovery._ (this one may not help much, but I think I remember there being some "repair" option in there.

user
Jaime Santa Cruz:  Thank you.  I'll try those again.  After I tried many, I even printed out the 'Startup key combinations for Mac' official list from Apple Support, and tried them all again, except the ones that required the internet connection, which I'm using now to get help from AD/you.  I ended up with white screen hang, but I will try the above again per your suggestion.  Then,I'll have to change internet connection and try the  Option-D Startup AHT or AD over the internet... BUT I won't know what to do once I get there unless there are instructions.  Thanks!Where did my comment go?  Trying again:  Thanks.  That's the list of official Apple Startup Key Combination for Mac I printed out after trying some I found elsewhere.  Then I went thru the entire list again, except the ones requiring internet connection, which is on this machine, obviously.  I will try the above again, but if I get into the AHT/AD, or even OS X Recovery, I won't know what to do. I'll connect the internet to the MacPro2008 with white screen hang and do the Option-D and Comman-Option-D over the internet and see.  The MP2012 I'm on now is for sale.Sorry, my first reply wasn't showing up, now there it is and I can't seem to delete it.Shift ended up in another black screen crash.  When it powered up again, I held the D, and it also crashed, then when it came on again, I pressed Command-R and NOW I have 2 different graphics oscillating back and forth, I've had this before but I didn't know what to do.  One looks like it may be a mouse with an arrow pointing UP but I tried and there's no switch on my MightyMouse.  The other's probably a keyboard and I have the metal flat kbd with nothing on the side to switch.  So... I hope you're there now!  I'll let this continue and wait a while to see if you reply.  Thanks!I tried all your suggestions and came up with the oscillating graphics but didn't know what to do with them.  I stepped out for a minute and when I came back, it was black screen, no response, but the power light at the button was still on.  Later, I tried the internet startups: Command-Option-R and Option-D with same white screen hang.  Trying the Command-Option-P-R again it kept rebooting over and over to black screen without going into the logo and startup.  In each case the progress bar always goes around 1/4 to 1/3 across, then to white screen.  Thanks.

agent
Well..I have to say I'm stumped...The tablet should not be able to do that much damage to your install.  Only thing I can think of now is to reinstall OSX, which you probably can do from the 2012 to the 2008, as long as you have an 8GB USB stick and a (Firewire?) cable you can connect to two together with? (You would end up losing anything on the 2008 though)

user
Thank you.  You're probably right... unfortunately.  I DO get to the 2 oscillating graphics, one looks like a mouse with an arrow apparently suggesting to push a tab or something in the upward position but there isn't one that I can see, on my mouse.  And the other pic looks like it might represent the side of a slim keyboard with a mark on the side maybe suggesting doing something there, but nothing but the mouse usb plug on the sides of these metal flat keyboards.  So, what am I supposed to do once I see that?  I pressed a few keys but nothing went to next screen, then it black screened. ThxI emailed nextbook tech support and also contacted nearest Mac authorized repair over an hour away... may take it there.  BUT if you have input on the 2 oscillating graphics, I can try that first.  Yea or nay so I know whether or not to go elsewhere.  I appreciate your help.  Thank you.

agent
I think you may better taking it to the Mac repair place, but bring the tablet and have them set it up for you while they're at it.

user
Thank you so much for all your help.  I took the tablet back.  I hope I don't need it when I take this to repair.  I was thinking of getting a new HD from OWC and putting that in bay 1/boot, format/install OSX, then put this trashed drive in bay 2 and mess with it a bit.  Then, if necessary, take the drive out and take it to repair, IF that will work.  Do you think it will work?  I'm using my OLD Mac Mini for internet since the 2012 sold, and having trouble with 'basic mode' email client, so if you don't hear back, that's why until I get another computer.  Thank you so much for your help.

agent
Well, having another drive that boots would let get your stuff off the old one so long as the old drive itself hasn't failed, so it's definitely worth a shot. Maybe just wipe the old drive and keep it as a backup after.

user
Thank you. I messed with it more and got thru the Option hold again to the choices of startups with the boot USB plugged in. This time, I chose the 'Recovery' disk option and got thru the 'Reinstall OSX' ordeal. Getting thru the setup screens it did get my Desktop back. I'm doing an emergency backup now, just in case, THEN, I'll try powering down and back up again to see if it's going to stay put.  I may be back!  Thanks again for your invaluable help.  Hopefully I can return the gift some day.

Is there a possibility to find out how much storage is free on a SSD of a Fusion Drive disk (SSD + HDD as a logical device)?

Perhaps it's important to say, that I've encrypted the whole fusion drive. The standard way does not work in this case:$ df -h /dev/disk0s2df: /dev/disk0s2: Raw devices not supported$ df -h /dev/disk0df: /dev/disk0: Raw devices not supportedThanks in advance for your effort.

agent
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/11/achieving-fusion-with-a-service-training-doc-ars-tears-open-apples-fusion-drive/" rel="nofollow">At least 4 GB of the SSD portion of a Fusion drive is left empty at all times</a>. That space is used for incoming writes. If there's less than 4 GB of empty space on the SSD, Core Storage will start offloading data to the HDD.So if all your data is less than your SSD capacity less 4 GB, then you have whatever your SSD capacity is (128 GB on all Apple supplied Fusion drives) minus the amount of your data. Otherwise, you've got 4 GB free.As an aside, the reason df doesn't work in this case is that it only reads filesystems. The filesystem sits atop the logical volume created by Core Storage (the software behind Fusion) — there's no "SSD portion" or "HDD portion", to the filesystem it's all one big drive.

user
Thanks for the explanation and the link. I'll give you an upvote when I've earned enough reputation. The 4GB "landing zone" seems okay but shouldn't it be a bit more than this? In my case I use a 256GB SSD (as you can see above) and as far as I know there should be at least about 10-15% storage free on the SSD so that it can work efficiently. According to this calculation Fusion Drive should leave about 26-38GB of free space all the time. I'm wondering if there is any way to tell Fusion Drive how big the "landing zone" should be (and also if this would lead to improved speeds).

agent
It varies depending on the type of SSDs, but most keep an area of spare space beyond the advertised capacity, to help deal with that, as well as to deal with NAND wear and so forth. To be honest, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Spare area can have an effect on SSDs, but the effects and required space varies a lot. If you *really* wanted to set aside more spare area, you could partition the drive so that there's an empty partition, and use the rest for the Fusion drive.

user
I just read that on my SSD (Samsung 840 PRO) a spare area of about 7GB is kept by the device itself. Additional to this there are the 4GB that you mentioned so there should be about 11GB in total that are kept free over most of the time. Thanks for mentioning the idea of keeping an empty partition. I never thought about this but it could be a possibility for the future. I'll keep it in mind and think about repartition the SSD if I get the feeling that the device has been slowed down over time. Thanks again for your effort!

I have a 2013 16Gb iPhone 5S, It worked properly until an annoying screen/touchscreen issue appeared yesterday .Here is the issue :The screen suddenly gets slightly darker and some shadows appear under black texts and shapes.The touchscreen stops working but works back when I lock and unlock my iPhone.The slightly darker screen and the blacks shadows issues continue after locking-then-unlocking and then suddenly go away.So the issue is a sudden screen issue (it gets darker and so shadows appear under black shapes and texts) along with a temporary touchscreen problem that goes away after locking then unlocking the device .<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQG79.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

agent
Great picture. I'm not sure I would be able to answer from the words alone.If you focus on two areas - just above the words Airdrop - the fading/smearing looks quite evident.the speaker icon for mute/low volume has definite "smearing"the >> fast forward black triangles also exhibit "smearing"I don't know the technical term for that bleed, but it's a hardware issue with the voltage controlling the LCD panel. Either the chip that drives the graphics is failing or the connections between the circuits embedded in the LCD and the controlling chip. Basically, reseating the LVDS cable would be the first things I would try if I were a repair technician and needing to fix a phone with that display.To check your phone against other phones and devices, this web page is fabulous for test patterns:<a href="http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/all_tests.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/all_tests.php</a>You'll want the detailed pages for how to use them, but the link above is my gold standard for just looking at two screens side by side to get a quick check of the LCD calibration and performance.Without opening the hardware and inspecting things, here are questions I'd ask before getting a repair:Has the phone been dropped recently or had a large shock (even in case, a drop can cause internal damage)?Is there warranty or AppleCare coverage? (If so - seek repair before it expires)Has the phone been opened by Apple or anyone else recently (or ever?)?

user
But why does the touchscreen stops working when this display issue occurs until I lock then unlock my device?

agent
@reaffer I would speculate that cable damage or voltage fluctuations / defects in the hardware could cause both issues. If you keep track of when things happen on paper - you'll know if they always come at the same tim or if it's just a coincidence. Sorry I can't offer more details. I haven't worked on iPhone 5S but know how things work in general from opening / repairing all manner of Mac and older iPhones. There might be some practical advice to be had from someone that repairs iPhone 5S generation hardware, but I have nothing more solid to add to the answer. :-(

It's not a coincidence but I totally appreciate your help, you clarified the issue for me, thanks.

Is there any Mac OS software that supports properly Windows Terminal Server RemoteApp?  By Properly I mean with an experience comparable to Windows Remote Desktop, that is, the Remote App Window is resizeable, etc, as if it was just another application.Most tools (RDC for Mac, CoRD) seem to simply open a desktop for the application, but it does not have a truly windowed behavior.

agent
Not even the official Microsoft RDP Client for OS X supports this; in fact that product still cannot do Terminal Services Gateway connections that were introduced with Windows Server 2008But the answer to your question is, yes there is at least one client that promotes full RemoteFX implemetation in their OS X client (and incidentally also TSG), and that's <a href="http://itap-mobile.com/desktop/rdp" rel="nofollow">iTap Mobile RDP</a>.  It is a commercial program however there is a trial version available from that page.  Update: it looks like iTap don't fully support RemoteAppThe only other client I can find is one by Thinomenon.  <a href="http://www.thinomenon.com/products/RemoteDesktopClient/osx.aspx#details" rel="nofollow">Their free client</a> supports all versions of the RDP protocol up to 7 (RemoteApp requires 6.1 or greater)Enjoy latest RDP features, including application publishing (RemoteApp or RAIL), even if your platform is not supported by Microsoft.Product Features: - RDP 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1 and 7 -compatible, - Copy and Paste via clipboard, - Encryption for communication security, - Local audio.

user
I just tried iTap Mobile RDP and I cannot make it work as a resizeable window.  If I open the same .rdp file I use on Windows, it lauches full scheen, and if I switch to non-fullsecreen mode, there is not a seemless resizing connection among the Windows application window frame and the Mac window frame.  MOreover, if I launch a Windows Explorer from the Windows application, its the Explorer window is not a Mac Window by itself, but instead is confined within the application's window.  Is there any iTap Mobile RDP setting that I am missing?

agent
is this just a standard RDP file for full desktop connection, or has it been modified and conffiured for the RemoteApp?updated my answer, unfortunately never used the product from Thinomenon but as far as I can see, it's the only client of OSX that supports 6.1 and above.

user
I was simply using the same RDP file that I was using for Windows (the one provided by our IT department). The Thinomenon product does work well (with regards to the windowing experience).

I'm trying to intall Windows 7 on my Mid 2009 Macbook Pro, however I'm running into A LOT of trouble.My superdrive have been broken for years and I can't boot from a bootable USB. (I created one in Virtual Box using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Tool)I then followed this tutorial on how to start the installation from within VMWare Fusion (<a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/2156#" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/2156#</a>), which seemed to work at first, but once I rebooted and selected the Windows Partition I got an error saying that windows could not be installed due to "recent software or hardware changes".I had selected the x86 version, so I figured I might as well try the x64 version and see if that makes a difference.So I removed my bootcamp partition, created it again, went into VMWare after doing the same process as before, now I simply get a message saying "No operating system found".I'm wondering with my options are to actually install Windows without a superdrive or a bootable USB.Can I just copy the installation files to the bootcamp partition and "make it start"?

agent
Try using <a href="http://wintoflash.com/download/en/" rel="nofollow">WinToFlash</a> in creating your bootable USB.I also ran into problems when creating a Bootcamp partition. I also don't have access to a SuperDrive when I created a Windows partition.First, use WinToFlash on your Windows 7 iso. Please use at least a 4GB USB drive and make sure that you don't have any important files in that drive as WinToFlash will delete all files when creating the bootable USB. After creating the bootable USB, go ahead and create a Bootcamp partition in your Mac drive using this <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=2672" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>. Hope this helps.

The problem is that I can't boot from a USB, even though I created multiple bootable ones

I bought it online a few months ago, I used the same copy to install it on my VirtualBox before, I'm trying it again now, maybe something went wrong in the process.I see what happened, for some reason WinToFlash never copies the install.wim file, even though there is enough space left, it doesn't want to copy that specific file

agent
I'm not sure if this will work but have you formatted your drive to FAT32 before using WinToFlash?

user
I did, I've been trying for the past 4 days now, but no luck, I got to the point where the installation was about to start, but then i got a message saying it failed to load install.wim. I guess it might just be easier to run VirtualBox and deal with the slow performance.

So I know some questions have already been asked about this like <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23561/is-there-a-quicklook-preview-for-plain-text-files-with-unknown-extensions">Is there a QuickLook preview for plain-text files with unknown extensions?</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7799/quicklook-for-files-with-no-extension-or-an-unknown-extension">QuickLook for files with no extension or an unknown extension</a>, but those questions are regarding fixes as oppose to Apple's reasoning behind not supporting QuickLook for some file types. I have many text files that I use with TextEdit, some in .rtf format and some in .txt format. I also have many .docx files for school. I'm pretty sure Microsoft created the plugin for QuickLook to work with .docx files. .rtf files are also supported by QuickLook.Text files seem like the simplest file type, because unlike .rtf files, they lack elaborate text ornamentation and (sometimes) complex formatting.Why aren't .txt files supported by QuickLook? Are they more elaborate than they seem, or is there something I'm missing?UPDATE:Here's an illustration of what I'm talking about:

agent
Normally, text files are supported by QuickLook. If you have one that isn't, chances are that there is something "odd" about the file, at least from the Finder's point of view.Try opening the file in TextEdit and then choose "Format" and then "Make Rich Text" as shown here:<a href="http://images.luo.ma/TextEdit-Format-Make-Rich-Text.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://images.luo.ma/TextEdit-Format-Make-Rich-Text.jpg</a>Type a space (or modify the document in some other minor way).go back to the "Format" menu and choose "Make Plain Text" again. Save the file. Check to see if QuickLook is able to show the file.

user
I tried that and it didn't work...

agent
Bummer. If you create a new plain text document and then copy/paste from the old to the new, and then save it, does the new file work in QuickLook? I presume that you've tried rebooting and `qlmanage -r`

user
So I've run `qlmanage -r` in Terminal and rebooted. I then tried to make a new plain text file and copied in the old content, and QuickLook still doesn't work...

Connecting two external monitors to my Retina Macbook Pro 2012 has no problem except for more fan noise, which is a little bit annoying since with one external monitor one doesn't hear the noise at all. I'm wondering what's the cause of this? What is the bottleneck here? Is it because GPU Clock Speed or Memory of Graphics Card?rMBP 2012 has Nvidia GeForce GT 650M with 1 GB GDDR5. If I switch to rMBP 2013/2014 which has Nvidia GeForce GT 750M with 2 GB GDDR5 and say if the problem disappears (I'm just guessing), is it mainly because of higher GPU speed or more memory? Btw, <a href="http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce%20GT%20650M" rel="nofollow">650M scores</a> 1278 while <a href="http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce%20GT%20750M" rel="nofollow">750M scores</a> 1461.Update 01/25/15: iStat Menu: iStat Menu monitors both CPU/GPU usage and temperature. Compared to only one external monitor, two external monitors causes CPU &amp; GPU temperature up by 20F higher. However, CPU &amp; GPU usage &amp; GPU memory usage all remain the same. The bottom line is that iStat Menu can't explain the increase in CPU/GPU temperature. 

agent
I would recommend the <a href="http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/" rel="nofollow">iStat Monitor</a> to find out what is going on.In comparison the 750 vs 650:50/45 watt power consumptionand 967 vs 900 MHz clock would not explain the higher heat generation.However due to the RAM size difference it could explain that the 650 has to work harder (at max power) resulting in higher heat generation, while the 750 does not break the sweat with 2 monitors.

user
I do think iStat Menus would work. However, I installed iStat Menus on my computer before and the trial period has passed. So it won't work for me now. I'm hoping to get some theoretical answers: e.g. what would happen if the GPU Speed is the bottleneck and what would happen if the memory is the bottleneck.

agent
So you are not looking at what is the temperature but the data load/flow!

user
I am looking into the causes of a high temperature. If iStat Menus tell me that my GPU runs at 200 degrees, I know that my GPU is running at its limit, but I still don't know what's the cause of it: GPU Speed or Memory.I do agree that iStat Menus is one solution, since it can tell me the usage of GPU and memory of Graphics Card.

I'm not too far off from releasing my first Cordova-based iOS / Android app. The final step is to upload screenshots of my app in various resolutions (e.g. one to show how it looks on iPhone 6 Plus, one for iPhone 4 etc.).I have an iPhone 4, and a 2009 Macbook with 2gb of RAM in it (both second hand from eBay. I just needed the bare minimum for development purposes), so running a simulator is painfully slow and takes a long time to do most thingsIs there a quick and easy way to prepare the 20 or so screenshots I need without having to own or get access to various sized iPhones, or struggle through the simulator? I'm looking for something I can use fairly often as I release new versions so I don't have to struggle every time.

agent
I'm afraid that is the only way. Unless you want to open the app on a 6 Plus and Photoshop all the images smaller for each device (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/app-screenshots-image-screenshot/id1101951791?mt=12" rel="nofollow">app for that</a>), which is a very horrible idea but the only one I can think of accomplishing this without the simulator.To make it easier to do the screenshots, instead of pressing ctrl+alt+C then bring it into Photoshop, you can now just cmd+S and the screenshot will be saved to your desktop ready to drag and drop into iTunes Connect. Make sure your device scale is on 100%:Simulator -> Window -> Scale -> 100%

user
I think I've found an XCode UI test that does this for me: https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot . I haven't tried it yet (something I'll do tomorrow when I have some time to work on the app) but it seems to do most of everything for you.It requires some set up, but can automate the grabbing of all screenshots and sizes, so I can let it run overnight and not deal with the painfully slow simulator

agent
wow.. looks promising! How did it work for you?

user
Not great. The UI test only picked up half of the button presses due to it not being able to correctly read the buttons in the web view. So I used Firefox instead (see my answer below). But if I get another Mac in the future and I learn to write native apps, I'll definitely give this a go again.

I used to have my up and down arrow keys in the Microsoft keyboard programmed to "send backward" or "bring forward" when using InDesign on my Mac. Somehow I set it back to default settings (so they now move things up and down). How can I reprogram them? I checked the Apple menu>system preferences>keyboard and didn't see those keys listed. I also tried apple menu>system preferences>microsoft keyboard. I assume it can be done here but I can't figure out how. Can someone please explain to me in detail? BTW I'm not great with computers or computer lingo so be very detailed and speak in layman's terms. Thanks!

agent
Adobe apps have their own Keyboard Shortcuts setup, in the Edit menu.I don't have InDesign, only Photoshop, but this is what it looks like in there…It's in Layer > Arrange [you need to do a lot of scrolling to get there]<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNHD1.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>After comments…It may not be possible to assign a single-key shortcut in Adobe, it may always need to include  Cmd ⌘  however, you could perhaps do the equivalent inSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard > App Shortcutsby assigning each one to 'All Applications' - which will then work in any app that actually has that precisely-worded command…<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbjC3.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

user
Yes. I tried that in photoshop. It wouldn't allow me to select the arrow key(s). In InDesign I can't even figure out how to find the option "send backword" or "send forward".... Also, I am positive that isn't how I did this before because once those keys were assigned, they performed that function in every program I have.

ah, OK, that makes me think you did it a different way - see my edit.

Is there a way to tell finder not to save any metadata about folders?I would love to get Finder to forget how it displayed any folder the last time I viewed it.So when expanding a folder it does not expand the whole subtree I opened last time.

agent
Have a look at <a href="https://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/12/24/death-to-ds_store/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Death to DS_Store</a>.The <a href="https://github.com/snielsen/DeathToDSStore" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source code</a> is available on GitHub and the <a href="http://www.aorensoftware.com/Downloads/Files/DeathToDSStore.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">binary</a> is available as well.

user
Does it stop the finder from remembering the expand/collapse status of folders?

agent
Yes, as this state is saved in the .DS_Store file as well.

user
Unfortunately this does not do the trick. The expanded/collapsed state is not persisted throughout system reboots, but during a session the folders stay expanded/collapsed. So this state is probably saved somewhere else too, not just the .DS_Store files.

agent
Please let us know what version of OS X/macOS you are using.

Using OSX 10.11. I have diabled SIP. DeathToDSStore is installed succesful and has a launch agent, so yes, even after rebooting no .DS_Store files reappeared, and i dont have any .DS_Store files left on my device which i removed with:`sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;`

I've tried looking for an app that caches map data, so that it doesn't need an active Internet connection on the move.The built-in one doesn't work well in that aspect. Caching the satellite maps turns out to be a nightmare because of the zoom levels involved. Only the road maps (the non-satellite ones) are somewhat easy to cache, depending on how large an area you want to cache.Is there a way to cache areas in the Maps apps?If not, is there a good app that caches satellite/hybrid map data? Paid apps will do.

agent
Advanced caching options are not supported for the build-in maps application. If other applications would provide this using Google's maps data, they would act against the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/terms" rel="nofollow">Google Maps TOS</a>. See section 10.1.3 "Restrictions against Data Export or Copying" - (b) "No Pre-Fetching, Caching, or Storage of Content". This leaves us with apps which use other maps data. Such as...<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/offmaps-2/id403232367?mt=8" rel="nofollow">OffMaps 2</a> (for iPhone/iPad)OffMaps 2 allows you to download maps for offline use. The maps data is originally retrieved from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a>.You download maps on a per-region-basis. Two maps are included for free.You can purchase a download 'licence' for unlimited maps for $5.99.I wondered myself how they could demand money for open data - <a href="http://www.offmaps.com/support-offline-maps.htm" rel="nofollow">they say</a>:  We do not charge for the data, but for the service we provide around it. We clean the data and leverage its full potential from removing unneeded information via linked addresses with streets to providing a public transport layer. We also need money to feed the hamsters in our server farm treadmills.

user
It's unfortunate that Google disallows offline caching. Do you know how OffMaps compares to Google Maps in the level of detail?

agent
@Hippo The level of detail and other information in OpenStreetMap is very high. In rural areas it is often more detailed than Google Maps (which of course depends on the region). See for yourself how detailed the areas are which you need maps for on http://www.openstreetmap.org/

user
The level of detail looks good, but it doesn't seem to support satellite imagery. I'll accept this as the answer since it seems this is the best we can get without jailbraking and violating Google's TOS.

My launchpad has become very cluttered overtime. I'm wondering if there is a function to reset launchpad like the iOS <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/06/14/reset-the-home-screen-layout-ios/" rel="nofollow">reset home screen layout</a> feature. Let me know in the comments if you don't understand what I'm asking.

agent
To reset Launchpad to the default, delete the following file:/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Dock/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.dbWhere "xxxx..." in the file name is an alphanumeric string.And then run the following command in a Terminal: killall DockThe Launchpad is now reset to the default and a new database (.db file) will be created with the default settings.Note:  If you want to examine the contents of the database you can use an app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liya/id455484422?mt=12" rel="nofollow">Liya</a>.

user
Does this remove all the app icons? I want to be perfectly clear before doing this :)

agent
@www139, I've tested this on my own system and saw no adverse effects.  One should not just delete a file without having a backup so as to be able to revert to the previous state if needed/wanted. As to  "_Does this remove all the app icons?_", in what context are you referring to? I had my Launchpad set alphabetical using LaunchpadCleaner and when I manually removed the target file and `killall Dock` the Launchpad was reset to having the OS X default apps first as arranged upon first boot and everything I installed since came after the default apps. All icons still showed as I expected.

I have a brand new MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014). Shipped with Yosemitee pre-installed, the version I have is 10.10.1 . I don't have any software installed except Google Chrome, so it is clean/new OS. I noticed sometimes the keyboard and trackpad become completely unresponsive after waking up the laptop from sleep. Happened several times, the last time it happened I could not reset PRAM or SMC as keyboard was unresponsive even after restarting or shutting down so I had to Re-Install OS.Today I was able to reproduce the issue, first I tried to let it go into Sleep mode several times with no device plugged into the USBs, and Lid left opened. I could not reproduce, both were working when I wake the laptop.Then I plugged in a USB Mouse, left the lid opened, and let it go to sleep for 1 hr. When I waked it up, the keyboard/mouse were unresponsive. Then I unplugged the mouse usb, let it go into sleep mode, and closed the lid .. for few minutes. Then I opened the lid, waked it up .. this time both were responsive and working.I was able to reproduce the above scenarios, so it is not a random thing.So, is there some kind of a log or test I can use to reproduce or while reproducing the unresponsive case above so I can understand if it is a hardware or software problem ?

Interesting .. I don't use any device from zte.com.cn, I don't know where that name came from. may be a virus ? :)As for remote management and sharing, it is not enabled, disabled in my both laptops.

Old macbook name in network is "Ahmads-MacBook-Pro-2.local" and the new one is "Ahmads-MacBook-Pro.local" but I doubt it has anything to do with this bug.I have not  tried the rct alarm wakeup fix solution yet. Right now whenever I try to leave my laptop i un-plug everything :) now I have another problem where kernal_test goes banana and consume cpu usages +500. This OS is useless and as a coder I cannot do any useful thing on it, and I cannot downgrade to Mavericks as this machine is pre-installed with Yosemite -_- Thanks for your help!

agent
Actually your computer is in trouble. I would recommend you do the cmd-r and reinstall Yosemite. If you want you can go back to Mavericks but that is another story.

user
Thanks for your help so far! Should I start new question about downgrading to Mavericks ? I have searched online and most of them are saying you cannot downgrade because the machine comes with Yoesmite pre-installed.

agent
For now just restore the Yosemite and see if it works. As I said you have lots of stuff going on that should not be. Yes getting Mavericks could be tricky, for example you would have to wipe the hard drive and have Mavericks Installer (not available online).

user
I have reinstalled Yosemite 2 times in the past 10 days, I purchased it 14 days ago :) the unresponsive issue will keep happening, and the kernal_test issue started to happen after I started installing softwares, so probably i will end up with same problem after re-installing :S I have mavericks installed into a hard disk (external) but when I tried to install it it declined stating that it is old version.

I have an Automator script that uses ffmpeg to re-encapsulate a video file into an mp4 container with its audio transcoded to aac while leaving the video as is.for f in "$@"do    /Applications/Scriptlets/ffmpeg -i "$f" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 384k -strict -2 "${f%.*}.m4v"doneThis works fine and the resulting video plays well on my system in both iTunes as well as Quick Time Pro; tried it with both avi and mov source files. However, I just noticed that the resulting files have their audio encoded to MPEG-4 HE AAC instead of plain AAC as intended. As a result, even though the file plays well on my Mac, I am unable to play it on my TV which recognizes AAC but not HE-AAC. Any workaround using ffmpeg? Please note that I am not interested in installing yet another encoding/transcoding application for this job. I only want to use ffmpeg so please do not suggest installing anything else.

agent
The problem is your ffmpeg. If telling ffmpeg to use aac causes it to encode in he aac, if that is true, then there is something wrong with your ffmpeg, because specifying aac should never result in he aac. Only telling ffmpeg to encode using libaacplus or libfdk_aac should result in he aac encodes.Here's an idea... build your own ffmpeg from source, because your binary was built wrong (if what you are saying is true).You can download the ffmpeg source and build it manually:  git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpegBut its far easier to install it using package management, like macports:MacPorts requires an appropriate version of xcode; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_5.1.1/xcode_5.1.1.dmg" rel="nofollow">xcode_5.1.1.dmg</a> is the most recent version for Mavericks (after <a href="https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action" rel="nofollow">registerring</a> for a free developer account, and <a href="https://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/wa/login?&amp;appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&amp;path=%2F%2Fdevcenter%2Fmac%2Findex.action" rel="nofollow">logging in</a>to developer.apple.com, that link will begin your xcode download).

user
A complete layman here so I have some questions despite your thorough explanation: First, what's git? is it something I just run on my Terminal and the rest is taken care of by my shell? Or is it something I need to separately install? I tried opening the link you gave (git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git) and it obviously didn't open in Safari. I already have Xcode installed on my system but the whole macports process seems overly complicated. Maybe because I am far from tech-savvy. :(Also, though I already have Xcode installed, I am curious about the Terminal method of installation suggested by you ( hdiutil attach -quiet -noverify -nobrowse -noautoopen ~/Downloads/xcode_5.1.1.dmg cp -npR /Volumes/Xcode/Xcode.app /Applications/ hdiutil detach -quiet /Volumes/Xcode). I installed it off my App Store. Is there any particular advantage in going the Terminal route for installing Xcode?

agent
Yes, the advantage is that you won't have to deal with App Store. git is a way to "check out" software like checking out a library book. Its really much simpler to build ffmpeg using macports, because macports will take care of all the dependencies for you, download and build them all for you. If you tried to use that git command, you just get the ffmpeg source, and the build will fail because you're missing all the other source of the dependencies. Just start at "Download and build MacPorts" It won't interfere with anything, and if you don't like it, you can remove everything quite simply.

user
I tried following your steps and everything seems to go well at first. But then my Terminal threw a "command not found" at this step: sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate

agent
But you're going to love it, I assure you. It only seems like a lot of commands to build one port, ffmpeg. But you then have access to all of macports with a simple command, `port`. For example, to build mediainfo, which is a great little media analysis tool, you install it the same way: `sudo port -vsc install mediainfo` or to build HandBrake its `sudo port -vsc install handbrake` ; Search for stuff with `port search something` and it returns names of ports that are germane. Then you'd `port info something` to get info about it. then `sudo port -vsc install something` to build from source@AmitSchandillia Did you build macports? Start at `curl -Ok https://`

user
I did exactly as you instructed starting at the curl line and all the way through the "rm -rf Macports-*" line. Then it threw a "command not found" at the sudo that comes after.

I have an applescript that checks my macbook battery and forces hibernation when it reaches a certain level, after displaying a 60 sec countdown.I've successfully set it up to run in the background via launchd, every 30 secs, as a script but this causes an annoying bouncing icon on the dock.So, I saved the script as an app and now the dock icon is no longer bouncing but if I am in the terminal app (for example) and I happen to be pressing CONTROL just as it launches in the background, I get the dreaded "Press Run to run this script, or Quit to quit" dialog box. And yes I have made sure that when I save it the "Startup Screen" option is NOT selected. This dialog appears behind all other windows so I have no idea that it has happened and my app/script is stuck at this point.Any suggestions how to overcome this so I can run my script with no annoying dialogs or bouncing icons?Thanks.EDIT: One idea that came to mind was to use the ExitTimeOut option in the plist file. The man page says:ExitTimeOut &lt;integer&gt;    The amount of time launchd waits before sending a SIGKILL signal. The default value is 20 seconds. The    value zero is interpreted as infinity.So I added it in like this:&lt;key&gt;ServiceDescription&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;string&gt;Battery Monitor&lt;/string&gt;&lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;integer&gt;30&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;key&gt;ExitTimeOut&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;integer&gt;90&lt;/integer&gt;then did unload/load of the .plist file. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to work. Am I understanding this option wrong?

agent
Convert to Shell Script and AppleScript PairConvert your check for the battery status to a shell script. The shell script can then run regularly through a launchd job ticket without presenting any user interface.When the conditions are met, your shell script can launch an AppleScript to interact with the user.This assumes you use an ~/Library/LaunchAgent approach for the launchd job ticket. A computer wide launchd job will not be able to launch the AppleScript component in the appropriate user session.Alternatively, you could use a third party tool to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97492/event-based-on-battery-charge-level">trigger on a battery event</a>, such as <a href="http://www.dssw.co.uk/blog/2014-02-10-how-to-shut-down-before-battery-the-fails/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Power Manager</a>; this would avoid polling your battery and improve your battery's performance.

user
That is a good idea. I'll give it a try, thx. Are you sure polling the battery affects it's performance?

agent
Running a script every 30 seconds will add load to your CPU and thus affect your battery performance. Ideally you want to hook into the battery system and wait for it to broadcast updates as events; search around "polling versus events" for more insights on this development topic.

user
Thx, I'll look into it. If anyone is interested in the bash version of the script it can be found here http://pastebin.com/1n3QvbEz. I'm accepting this as the answer.Me bad. I just realised that the script is missing the line that checks the current % with the min. The corrected script can be found here: http://pastebin.com/QhcT3FGg

When I connect from my laptop to my server with Apple Screen Sharing, it is extremely laggy, even over gigabit ethernet.Files copy at expected speeds (~100MB/s) but Screen Sharing is terribly slow.Any way to speed this up?

agent
Some (all?) Macs when run without a monitor turn off the video circuitry so they do not waste energy, even though this circuitry is used by screen sharing to dramatically speed up screen stuff.There might be a way to turn this circuitry back on through software, but I have not foud a reliable way to do so. What works very well is to plug in something into a video port to get the Mac to think it has a monitor connected.You can build one yourself:<a href="https://macminicolo.net/blog/files/build-a-dummy-dongle-for-a-headless-mac-mini.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://macminicolo.net/blog/files/build-a-dummy-dongle-for-a-headless-mac-mini.html</a>Buy one to plug into a HDMI port on some MacMinis:<a href="https://macminicolo.net/blog/files/an-hdmi-adapter-for-a-headless-mac-mini.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://macminicolo.net/blog/files/an-hdmi-adapter-for-a-headless-mac-mini.html</a>Buy one to plug into the MiniDisplay Port:<a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/NewerTech/CBLMDPHEAD/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://eshop.macsales.com/item/NewerTech/CBLMDPHEAD/</a>Instructions for a resistor added directly to the video card: <a href="http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=11" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=11</a>I picked up a handful of the HDMI ones a while back, they are very useful.A similar question/answer is at <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116809/force-the-resolution-on-a-headless-mac-mini-server">Force the resolution on a headless mac mini server</a> 

user
Aha! That makes sense. But there must be a way to trick the system into thinking it's got a monitor via software? The server is a Hackintosh, BTW.

agent
I wish. I tried various things, including http://www.airsquirrels.com/airparrot/ which some have claimed does the trick when it adds its virtual monitor driver stuff, but I was unable to see any real improvements, certainly none as large as those that happened when I plugged in a dongle. Try screen sharing with a Mac that has a monitor attached and you'll see the difference - smooth as silk as they say.If your server has a DVI output, you might be able to get by with just plugging in a single resistor in the approriate holes in the video card. I have seen reference to people using a paper-clip. http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=11

user
I was thinking of trying just a piece of wire... But might that damage my video card?

agent
It looks like it wants around 75 ohms, but people report it working with a variety of resistances. The zorinaq link has someone who claims it is pretty safe even with a paperclip, but getting a resistor and taping the leads so they don't short would probably be safest.

agent
  Is the Majority of Software available for the Mac now available for  purchase from the Mac App Store ? Are there Pros &amp; Cons to Mac App  Store purchasing?I don't know exactly how you would compile those numbers, or if Apple even releases numbers for the Mac App Store, so it's difficult to say how the "majority" is sold.As for pros and cons, probably the biggest pro is Mac App Store purchases can be used on any number of Macs that you own (see <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4461" rel="nofollow">Apple's FAQ</a>); you don't need to buy additional licenses for each machine as long as it's for personal use. Also, updates are delivered through the store, so you get a notification when updates are available.Installing from the Mac App Store is also presumably more secure because Apple has tested and approved all apps before making them available (and can revoke an app developer's certificate, which is a benefit assuming a rogue app sneaks through, but could also be a negative if they abuse that ability).  Do people still purchase directly from the company website that  created the software as an electronic download - I understand most  companies offer a free trial (usually 30 days)Well, sure, why not? There's no requirement that all apps have to go through the Mac App Store. However, the Mac App Store does not offer trials, so you'll need to purchase directly from the developer if you want a trial (assuming they offer one).  Do people still buy "boxed software" from retail outlets and online  retail stores ?Again, sure, of course you can if you want.  If the software is available via all these routes and maybe purchased  in other ways, is there a recommended (instinctive) way or do people  just go through the above options and see which turns out to be the  cheapest?I'd say the Mac App Store is the easiest and most straightforward option for most users, since it's integrated right into OS X and updates are delivered automatically.

user
Thankyou so much for giving quite a comprehensive answer and even informing me that the Mac App Store would not permit a free trial (which might be disadvantageous), compared to buying direct online. I hope new Apple users find this information as useful as I have and will bear this in mind on future purchases of Mac Software. Excellent

@Simon: I was wrong – there's actually no limit to the number of machines you can install a Mac App Store purchase on, as long as it's for personal use.

How can I get Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari Web browser?Is it dependent on my Safari version, my macOS version, or both? If so, which versions?

agent
  Is it dependent on my Safari version, my macOS version, or both? If so, which versions?Intelligent Tracking Prevention was first introduced in Safari 11 in macOS High Sierra 10.13 along with iOS 11 both of which were released in September 2017. It is available in macOS 10.13, iOS 11 and later.The same can be configured by going to Safari Preferences → Privacy → Website tracking: Prevent cross site tracking.To configure the same in iOS, go to Settings app → Safari → Prevent Cross-Site Tracking.ITP2 went into affect in iOS 12/Safari 12 during an update release. This update to ITP includes workarounds that marketers created.You can upgrade to Safari 12 while running macOS 10.12 Sierra. Safari 12 release notes can be referred to here:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history#Safari_12" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Safari version history</a>

user
So I can't use it if I have macOS 10.12, for example, then. You mention ITP2, but only with regards to iOS. Is it not available for macOS?

agent
ITP is available in Safari 11. ITP2 was released with Safari 12. You can upgrade to Safari 12 while running macOS 10.12 Sierra. Release notes here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history#Safari_12

user
In Safari 12 on macOS 10.12 in Safari Preferences → Privacy, it says only "Ask websites not to track me" (which I thought was simply the "Do Not Track" feature). Nowhere does it say "Prevent cross site tracking". I am therefore confused as to whether Safari 12 / macOS 10.12 has ITP.

agent
@forthrin It's the same thing. The Prevent cross-site tracking terminology is from Safari 12 running on macOS Mojave 10.14. You can refer to the Safari release notes which I have linked to in the answer above.

user
Are you sure about this? Quite confusing, I must say. At any rate, I'm getting poor results when testing Safari on tracking testing sites, so either I don't have ITP, or ITP is not very good. I posted a separate question about this.

If your Mac supports internet recovery, you can network boot directly to Apple's servers over the internet. Use Disk Utility to reformat your drive and then get macOS reinstalled from the network.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314</a>Be sure to be patient with Option - Command - R and make sure you get connected to WiFi or Ethernet to internet in the recovery screens before giving up on Internet Recovery. You might need to try several times or connect to another network if yours is filtered.If that doesn't work, boot your Mac in target disk mode and connect it to an OS that can repartition / reformat / reinstall the OS of your choice.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462</a>If that doesn't work, have someone you trust make you a bootable USB drive to reinstall macOS.

agent
Ok, so the problem seems to be that you don’t have the MultiClutch bundle in InputManagers. Multiclutch allows you to assign custom keyboard shortcuts in a given app to a given gesture, for example if you wanted to “swipe” to change a tab in safari or similar.  It works by installing a simple input  manager that catches gesture events,  looks to see what shortcut you’ve  defined for it in the frontmost app  (if you haven’t defined anything, it  behaves in the standard manner), and  performs that shortcut.I don’t know what iChrono does but you might try downloading <a href="http://wcrawford.org/2008/02/28/everytime-i-think-about-you-i-touch-my-cell/" rel="nofollow">MultiClutch (the free little app)</a> because that will surely install the InputManager, if you later “remove” it (by dragging it into the thrash), the Input Manager will stay there and your widget should be able to use it.Check that you have   /Library/InputManagers/MultiClutchInputManager.bundle… and if you do and it still doesn’t work, try thrashing that bundle (save a copy just in case) and see if you can get a new copy. UPDATE:Could you create a new user and try to download + decompress + install from that user instead? Logoff and login with the new user. There might be some weird or incompatible bundle sitting in your user.UPDATE 2As an added bonus, you can try to replace your Megazoomer’s SIMBL with the original one. I think you have an old version that somehow is not Universally compatible. To those effects a version was compiled by Mathias Meyer who forked the original version.You can find his version <a href="http://www.paperplanes.de/files/megazoomer.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a> (links to zip). Download and uncompress the zip and drop megazoomer.bundle into ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins (overwrite it!)I’ve taken this information from GITHUB: <a href="http://github.com/mattmatt/megazoomer" rel="nofollow">here</a>

Recently, I bought the iPad Pro 12.9 inch, 2017 model (as the title says) as well as the Apple Pencil, and I've been noticing a massive number of glitches that have been quite irritating. The glitches are as follows:Reboot (happened once, but irritating nonetheless) took a very long time, I estimate around 15 minutes. When the reboot finally completed, it displayed the battery as having only 1%, even though it had 65% 15 minutes before. I tried to reboot it, only for no response until after a couple times of holding the power key (might have been that I did not hold it long enough, so I might let that slide as an issue). When it rebooted once more, everything returned back to normal; but that weird reboot session made things seem off.The Locked Notes in the conventional Apple Notes App constantly have the menu (the one with the various "pens", eraser, selector, and colors) disappear after they lock. The workaround I have found for this issue is to find a note that has no lock on it whatsoever, open that up, and the menu appears back at the lower right hand corner. Then, I have to go all the way back to the locked note, open that up, and the menu is back.Animations appear a bit chunky, or laggy. For example, opening up the Control Panel (swipe up down from the dock) feels a bit slow. Additionally, there is some noticeable lag when swiping through the apps that appear with the control panel (say I want to close an app or just switch to another).When I swipe left on the lock screen, or home screen, or notifications screen to get to all the widgets and news, there is some lag as well. Animations again feel chunky. But that's not just it; sometimes the whole entire page just flickers and has to reload everything (reload all the widgets). One time, the screen momentarily locked into that screen as well.When I reboot the iPad, sometimes I see a white line that flickers at the bottom of the screen and then disappears. This white line appears during the black screen and apple symbol.The Files app doesn't always show all of the files; in fact, it makes it appear like there are no files in any of the sources at all! Sometimes it works and shows the files in my Google Drive, my iCloud, iPad, and Adobe Cloud, but often it doesnt. Even when it does show files, they sometimes seem to be some old, cached image of the files. It doesn't update as fast as it should. For example, I saved something from online to my iPad (and I was close to the router), and the Files app has yet to register it as actually being there.When the iPad turns off, it seems to just flicker, almost like it just got shocked, and then turn off. I am not quite sure if this is an error at all; but I would think that the turning off animation would be more of a fade and less of flicker (ideally).Failure to register the Apple Pencil until after a couple seconds in the Battery Widget. This is weird, because the pencil works fine and clearly must be already connected to do so, but the Battery widget has to reload to show the apple pencil again sometimes. This occurs after the pencil has been in use for some time, and has already been synced with the tablet.Again, I am new to the whole Apple ecosystem, and I can be overly critical of products. Therefore, I am not sure if I am just expecting too much and these "bugs" are normal, or whether I should contact AppleCare immediately (as this device could be defective).—————————————(New Updates)Messenger for Facebook now has a defective keyboard. Probably an app problem, but given the plethora of issues I have, probably best to still mention it. The problem: the keyboard stops typing completely. It’s not even laggy, just it won’t simply type. There’s response from the keyboard though, as theres sounds and the darkening of the button when I tap on it, but nothing is getting typed in. As I’m typing this on my iPad right now, the issue seems to only occur for that one app (as far as I’ve seen). Weird however, as to my knowledge there hasn’t been any sort of update. Animations seems to have improved a bit. I think doing a factory reset and wiping things clean made things work better. Reinstalled the stylus app for my iPad, which lets me write using my pencil instead of typing. I can note that issues seemed to arise after installing the app: but not quite sure yet of again.

The next best thing is to restore the iPhone software. Meaning erase the software and then using iTunes on a computer to restore the software with a refreshed iOS 11.0.2.  Backup iPhone via iCloud (optional but highly recommended)    Plug in iPhone to iTunes and click restore iPhone. iTunes should also  automatically backup the iPhone also. -  <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT201252" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT201252</a> **Make sure iTunes is up to  date and then restore.    Once restore is done you are going to get the hello screen on the  iPhone. Set up the iPhone properly then when you get the Apps &amp; Data  screen, restore from iCloud backup (unless you chose not to back it  up). - <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT204184" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT204184</a>Then your phone should be back up and working with your stuff back on it and the software glitches cleaned up.Give that a try 1st then give us a status report.

user
It seems to have solved most of the problems. However, it has only been one day since I have followed the instructions you have given. I'll give another report after using my iPad for a couple days more.

agent
Sure, feel free to keep me posted.

user
Hm, seems that some issues are back. Chunky animations again, but only when swiping up from the bottom (to access the background apps). Also, the screen flicker issue when turning off. Its chunky animation again: not a smooth fade like I expected

agent
@quantum.cmptr ok this time do the same thing, the restore. But don't bring your backup up. Set up the iPad as new a day see if it lasts longer. If it does, then it might be some files on your backup.

user
Yeah, I think it's some specific apps like a keyboard app and a scan app from Adobe. The iPad slows with these apps.

agent
Can you try to delete them and see if the performance improves?

user
No, hasn't done anything really. My original thoughts were wrong about them affecting performance. An effort to turn off background refresh seems to have done nothing, so no apps syncing in the background did anything. New problem noticed: When I exit the youtube app to view all the other apps (with the swipe up to enter multitasking view), normally the video is supposed to play smoothly in its shrunken app window. But however, it plays chunkily, with frames being dropped.

agent
Try the restore without bringing up your backup. It could be your files.

Didn’t work unfortunately. Also, I think it’s a good idea if I take a video of the ui to explain the chunkiness I’m seeing. It could give a better idea.

agent
Sure, please do. And list the link of the apps in the AppStore. If a restore doesnt fix it, then perhaps its a developer issue. Check the recent reviews for the app and see if any reflect on this issue.The restore without your backup is the #1 solution for all software issues for Apple. If its not software then its App Related or Hardware. If it only occurs in select apps, either remove them or contact the developer team. Thats usually the route of this type of issue.

Been a bit busy recently, so I haven’t had as much time to do a proper video showing as many animations as possible in various apps. Not to mention making a list of apps. But I did post some updates, as you can see in the answer.

I would call Apple support in the morning and discuss it with them. 1800myapple.Any updates on this?

user
Ah, its been a while. I think the vast majority of issues have been fixed, by just software updates. IOS 12 feels a tad slower, but thats probably due to the new gesture system, not an actual issue.

<a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/09/mac-address-randomization-joins-apples-heap-of-ios-8-privacy-improvements">iOS 8 is now implementing MAC address randomization</a>, where it randomizes your MAC address to networks while searching for networks.<a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/26/more-details-on-how-ios-8s-mac-address-randomization-feature-works-and-when-it-doesnt/">One article</a> describes it as:  One of those features, which is new in iOS 8, is the automatic  randomization of MAC addresses when the device is searching for a  Wi-Fi network. This makes it much more difficult to track a device by  seeing which Wi-Fi networks have spotted its unique identifier.However, once connected to a network, does it provide the true MAC address of the network card?

agent
It should, but I have found no source that explicitely states it. Apple writes in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Sept_2014.pdf" rel="nofollow">iOS Security Guide for September 2014</a> that  When iOS 8 is not associated with a Wi-Fi network and a device’s processor is asleep,  iOS 8 uses a randomized Media Access Control (MAC) address when conducting PNO  scans. When iOS 8 is not associated with a Wi-Fi network or a device’s processor is  asleep, iOS 8 uses a randomized MAC address when conducting ePNO scans. Because  a device's MAC address now changes when it's not connected to a network, it can’t  be used to persistently track a device by passive observers of Wi-Fi traffic. This is of course a bit ambigiuous because it doesn't explicitely describe the behaviour when the iDevice is connecting.It should be noted that contrary to the statement above, the MAC address randomization <a href="http://blog.airtightnetworks.com/ios8-mac-randomgate/" rel="nofollow">currently only works</a> if there is no cellular connection and Location Services are deactivated. 

user
I read through the link, and the post with his findings, but couldn't find anything that said or showed the real MAC address being passed upon connection. Do you have any resources to source for the "yes" answer?

agent
@John The most detailed description of the randomization feature I have seen is in [this document](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Sept_2014.pdf). It states on page 21 that iOS 8 uses random addresses for PNO/ePNO scans when it's not connected to a network. But you're right, it never states that iOS uses the real MAC address when connecting, though it would if one replaced two When's with [Iff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iff)'s.

user
If you can toss that link into your answer, I'll make it as the correct answer. Some support is better than none.

I'm looking for a piece of software akin to Cacti, one that is preferably much easier to set up, and has a high-quality frontend to it.I had a headless Linux desktop that I used to poll my Time Machine and graph network statistics off of, but that computer is currently undergoing repairs, so I'm left with the remaining computers I have in the house, which are all Mac.I have no specific requirements that I consider as a sticking point. My baseline of features would be something with the granularity that Cacti/RRDTool provide. Graphs with scalable units of time/history (configurable is a plus!), quick/easy to get started with little installation is preferable, something that perhaps just runs as a daemon/program and doesn't require a web server and detailed tailored configuration (read: discovery) would be just fine, and possibly even preferred.

agent
Unfortunately I'm not aware of any serious competition to Cacti, but have you considered using a Cacti virtual appliance? There are several pre-configured VMs available with everything pre-installed and ready to go.<a href="http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/va/722523" rel="nofollow">Cacti 0.8.7g</a><a href="http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/603" rel="nofollow">rPath Cacti Appliance</a>You might also want to take a look here:<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/duling/halfdozen/" rel="nofollow">A Half-Dozen or So Essential Open Source Network Administraton Tools</a>and in particular at:<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/duling/halfdozen/NRG-Howto-p1.html" rel="nofollow">Graph Network Performance with NRG - Part 1</a>He also has a page on how to <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/duling/halfdozen/Cacti-Howto.html" rel="nofollow">install Cacti on OS X</a>.Now I can't say that this meets your desire for something as simple as a typical OS X application install but it certainly meets the free requirement.I can't say I've played with any of these tools on OS X bar Mac Ports which I consider an essential on any OS X system.Another really simplistic app (OS X widget actually) is <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/networking_security/ieyenet.html" rel="nofollow">iEyeNet</a>, it definitely meets the free and simple criteria but isn't anywhere as configurable as Cacti. I tried it with my Airport Extreme and it "just worked".Another option is documented <a href="http://blog.cocoia.com/2007/graph-your-airport-express-extreme-data-throughput-and-more/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it uses a combination of MRTG/Lingon/Geektool to generate and display the network graphs. Reasonably easy to setup...

user
The concept of pre-built VMs scare me, to be perfectly honest. I guess getting them from VMware legitimately should be considered relatively safe.I really like JumpBox's dedication to this process, but I have to pay $50/mo. to use them? Oof... That's an expense I can't justify right now.

agent
As I understand it, it's $50 to get access to their download library and for continuing support, you could just pay for one month and the VM will still work (as long as you have it running locally). It is certainly more than I'd be willing to pay for personal use but for a small or medium business it might be worth it.

user
That rate ($50) is just plain too high right now. I'm sure I could game it and pay once, download, yay, the cancel then billing, repeat for any updates I want... I just... yuck. I pay less than that for TV stations in a country I don't live in! I do appreciate the suggestion, but I'd still love something competitive in native Mac land. And yes, I will evaluate using work's stance on this :).Ausmith1, something to note in the future. I was 100% unaware that you had made changes to this question, and your additions are GREAT!

I upgrade my brand new late 2012 Mac Mini's drive to an SSD and changed the RAM. Now when looking up the serial number in "About this mac" or System Profiler it just says "System serial#" :The Mini also performed an OS and EFI update before I noticed the problem.I cannot log in to iMessages and posts an the 'net lead me to believe the non-present serial number may be at fault.Already tried PRAM reset. Can it be easily reinstated or otherwise fixed  ?Update:The only deleterious effect seems to be the inability to log in to Messages with my AppleID. [Earlier edit of this question referenced being unable to download Mountain Lion from the App Store, this issue turned out to be unrelated.] Apple Support sent a new machine and replacing RAM and SSD did not cause a repeat of the problem. This machine is able to log in to Messsages.

agent
The logic board should carry the serial number, so the logical and most likely conclusion would be software corruption or perhaps a failure of the logic board.Check in terminal to see if the system information is truly missing:system_profiler SPHardwareDataTypeTowards the end of this listing should be a serial number field. Based on this result, you might reinstall the OS (if the serial shows under this command) - and even if this serial were missing, I might still try a reinstallation before taking it in for service. If you are close to a free service like a Genius Bar, you might stop in with the Mini (no need for cables) and ask if they can have a brief look. They'll tell you if you need to remove the RAM/HD or if they can determine the issue / quote a possible repair if it's not software.The more I think about this, I wonder if the Mac ever had a serial number written to the logic board. I would open a support case (worldwide <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HE57" rel="nofollow">contact for Apple support here</a>) and get it on the record as needing repair even if you aren't keen to send it in now. The sooner you report something, the more options you have. Normally, nothing ever fails since most software never reads the number, but it would be nice to have everything working on a Machine that is still under the one year warranty. 

user
No joy on the terminal command. No Genius Bar nearby either :-( I ordered the system from Apple's online store. There's no official Apple store in Belgium. What a mess.

agent
The web help is also very good. Start with the support and service links to the top right of the window you posted to show the error. Unless you are sure the serial was here before the upgrade (and those parts are user upgradeable, so you're not likely making problems with that operation) , it could be a rare oops from the factory where they didn't run the step where the logic board gets a serial number. I edited my answer - looks like you get both free phone support and web support in Belgium in English and Flemish if you prefer.

user
Called Apple Support, they are exchanging the machine for a new one. The guy at the helpdesk had never heard of this problem before. I hate being unique and interesting :-)

agent
@tyr I've seen it many times - but only once on a new Mac - now twice counting yours. Mine was before App Store days. Would you consider editing the answer out of the question and actually using the "answer your on question" function - especially since you have a very good answer for this. Mark yours as accepted, too! Thanks.

user
The Appstore stuff turned out to be a red herring as it persists on the fixed mini. Maybe it's running a special version of 10.8.x not yet rolled into the main installer ? So I'm accepting Grahams answer as most correct on the serial number question and editing out the irrelevant App Store part.

I found this line : "Parallels Desktop supports USB connected SD card readers. In order to find if you have Card Reader connected via USB, please follow these steps...". It felt as though they were talking about an external reader. Did you check your Card Reader tab? Does it work under OS X?

Sorry, I have forgotten to answer you. Recently I have updated the OS to El Capitan. And now it looks exactly the same as yours. But problem remains, SD cards are still not recognised.

Not sure if my Macbookpro Retina 2015 is waking up from sleep, safesleep or hibernation.I have enabled hibernatemode 25 (via terminal command: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25). pmset -g shows hibernatemode is indeed 25.Is this mode the equivalent of the Windows 7 hibernate and or, the hibernate button on the 'Deepsleep' widget/mac app <a href="http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/" rel="nofollow">http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/</a> or the other 'Deep Sleep' app's sleep button <a href="http://deepsleep.free.fr" rel="nofollow">http://deepsleep.free.fr</a> ?

agent
When you wake a Mac from hibernation, RAM got written to disk and power removed from memory. Then, at wake, it gets read back into RAM.  This takes longer than normal, or standby sleep (depending on the delay set) and is visible at wake time by showing an Apple symbol and progress bar underneath (white time markers filling up).Also running the following command in Terminal:pmset -g log | grep -i "wake from"will show the sleep states, e.g.   Wake from Hibernate   Wake from Normal Sleep   Wake from StandbyThe last time I saw the 'Deepsleep' widget in action, it did the same as hibernation, i.e. write to disk and remove power from memory.PS.As the man pages (man pmset) hint in the quote below, standby and autopoweroff should be set to the value "0", via the same pmset command you've used to set hibernatemode, to set your MacBook Pro to use hibernation instead of normal, or standby sleep (I would also disable any Energy Saver System Preferences to wake your Mac periodically):   For example, on desktops that support standby a hibernation image  will be written after the specified standbydelay time. To disable  hibernation images completely, ensure hibernatemode standby and  autopoweroff are all set to 0.PPS.  But please also consider the following thread here on AskDifferent:<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126669/how-to-add-hibernate-mode-to-macbook-pro">How to add hibernate mode to MacBook Pro</a>

user
Thank  you for your answer redarm. The log produced shows all sleep states were "Wake from Standby". Hibernatemode is set to 25 and Standbydelay to 1. However, I still get the same results. I wanted the mac to actually hibernate like a Windows PC does. I was told macs can actually do this and is evident when seeing the grey screen (https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201635). Still trying to figure this out.Btw Redarm, are you sure you've interpreted the man pages correctly? It says if you want to disable hibernation you should set values to 0, which is the opposite of what you mentioned in your PS.Hi Redarm, I disabled standby via the sudo pmset -a standby 0 command. I now get the grey screen with the progress bar. Howeover, when I run the pmset -g log | grep -i "wake from" command you mentioned, the log still shows Wake from Standby...I thought the grey screen with the progress bar means waking from hibernate. According to your command that is not the case.Do you have a link for your pmset manual? When I run the man pmset command I get a manual similar if no the same as this one: (http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/pmset/), which doesn't have the paragraph you  quoted below.

agent
Did you also set `autopoweroff` to 0? Both `standby` and `autopoweroff` set a delay, after which the system hibernates; so to achieve hibernation straight away, they would have to be 0.  With both set to 0 I see "wake from hibernation" in the log on a mid 2014 retina MacBook Pro straight away. No devices were attached - any drives attached will be ejected.Online there are only older (Mavericks) man pages:[https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html].  Another thread of interest on AskDifferent about the differences of `standby` and `autopoweroff`: [http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/113954/difference-between-autopoweroff-and-standby-in-pmset].`Standby` sleep is another form of hibernation.  The Mac will hibernate after a set delay. The relevant link to Apple's explanation: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202124

user
Thank you for your comment. I managed to do it! It's weird because according to the pmset manual autopoweroff is only valid when on AC mode ("The system will not power off if any external devices are connected, if the system is on battery power, or if the system is bound to a network..."). Or perhaps I misread read it and the opposite is true when deactivating autopoweroff. Anyway, now I just need to configure the settings to go to sleep as usual (e.g. when the machine is left for a short while) and then go to hibernate when I need it to power off. Thank you again @Redarm.

agent
The part you quoted (autopoweroff) has been removed in newer El Capitan's man pages.

user
Now I need to stop it from switching off the screen and going to hibernate after X seconds. I will try and configure some settings or ask a new question if that fails. Thank you again @Redarm. Some people including app developers thought I wouldn't be able to get the Wake from Hibernate result. Thanks for clarifying about the man pages. I guess that's another benefit of using El Capitan. Perhaps it's time to upgrade.

Here's my iCloud settings:<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d2k4z.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>As you can see, the Desktop and Documents Folders checkbox is unchecked. Despite this, my Desktop and Documents folders have suddenly been renamed to "Desktop - Local" and "Documents - Local" respectively.The only reason I can think of is this may be due to installing iOS 11 on my iPhone, but I'm not sure.Can anyone suggest any other possible reasons?

agent
This is caused by <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iCloud Drive</a>. This is to distinguish it with the Desktop and Documents folders on your iCloud Drive, which are named "Documents — iCloud", even if you didn't setup iCloud Drive on your Mac. The most probable cause, as found by the OP and me, is installing and running the new Files app on iOS 11.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0VSA.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>Note that iCloud Drive already works on iOS 10.2, so it's probably not caused by iOS 11, but you might have turned this option on during the installation of it?

user
It's already off as I've shown in my post.

agent
Hmmm ... strange. Maybe it's something which is cached by Finder. But even if you turned it off on your Mac, the iCloud Drive folder still exists.

user
I've never turned it on before.iOS11 has a new program called "Files" which automatically creates a folder called Documents on your iCloud drive, this might be the culprit reversely turning on iCloud Documents and Desktop.

Yeah, my further research is showing the same probable cause. You might want to post it as an answer yourself.

We know maximise a window in OS X (like we do in Ubuntu Unity or MS Windows) is not currently possible.Are there any third party extensions available from OS X App Store to achieve this?(I don't want to install applications that are not in App store for security reasons.)

Get <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/divvy-window-manager/id413857545?mt=12" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Divvy - Window Manager</a> app.It will let you maximize windows in the more traditional sense of taking all the screen space. It's solid, secure, reliable and can do many, many other things in addition to maximizing. There are many others on the store, but if you <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=divvy">search this site for Divvy</a> - you'll see it has wide

user
I tried Divvy but there seems to be no way of maximising windows using mouse clicks. But maximisation works with key combination.

agent
@DUKE It likely won't be possible for a MAS app to over-ride the organic buttons since there likely isn't a public API to change that behavior.

I finally find an application called "Cinch" in the app store. Simply dragging the tittle bar of the window to the top of the screen will maximise the window. Probably easier than clicking the small green button.

I'm using an app that makes http requests for content. I'd like to capture those requests and change them on the fly, so that a different request goes out to the http server, and thus different content comes back. I could do this with a full fledged web proxy, but I am hoping for a simpler and more transparent solution, possibly something that hooks into the OS to catch those network calls.AdMuncher is my program of choice for this task on Windows.

agent
Have a look at <a href="http://glimmerblocker.org" rel="nofollow">GlimmerBlocker</a> which primarily is an ad-blocking proxy but can also be used to rewrite requests and responses. 

user
I'll try it. Configuring my system to use a proxy is not ideal, but if nothing better comes along then this one seems like it could be the best option.

agent
AdMuncher works the same actually (from what I gather from the website), it's more or less the only way (unless you want to hack deeply into the relevant Cocoa libraries).

user
the difference is that AdMuncher hooks the network response functions in the OS, so you don't have to change configuration anywhere else. Any "normal" proxy software will involve telling the OS (or the browser itself) that you have a proxy that it should use. And some applications that open http connections at a lower level (such as `telnet google.com 80` from a console) would bypass such a proxy.

I live and work in the UK, but I am in the US for 2 weeks, and was wondering if I buy the new iPad from the Apple Store here in the States, will I be able to replace the AT&amp;T or Verizon SIM with an O2 or T-mobile (UK mobile carriers) SIM? Or are the iPads sold by the Apple Store locked to US based carriers?

agent
If you bought the device without a contract, it's unlocked!The information about AT&amp;T and Verizon is important when talking about LTE availability in the US. Only AT&amp;T and Verizon provide LTE networks in the US that work with the iPad.  4G LTE is supported only on AT&amp;T and Verizon networks in the U.S. and on Bell, Rogers, and Telus networks in Canada. <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">footnote no.3 - iPad specs</a>This is important to note as LTE frequency bands used in Europe, Australia and probably most of Asia are <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/42921/will-the-4g-lte-used-in-an-ipad-bought-in-england-also-work-in-sweden">not supported by the iPad</a>.

I don't understand your reply. Can you elaborate please?

Apple says: "4G LTE is supported only on AT&T and Verizon networks in the U.S. and on Bell, Rogers, and Telus networks in Canada."

The System Information view is misleading by naming it "Documents"Under the category "Documents" it will trow everything in in that is not in the other sidebar listed categories.For example in my case, it will show all my Movies as Documents.The misunderstood display .. it says my "Documents" are 92GB which is not true for Documents Folder.?<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zStm6.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>In your case....<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tQzJp.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"></a>

The category Documents (129.47GB) has Documents (32.89GB), Pictures, Music, etc....if you sum up their memory it wont be 129.47GB. If you sum all those I guess it will be around 33 or 34 GB. How come the main category shows 129.47GB?If you add all the memory in FileBrowser it should be size of Main category Documents. In my case it is not like that

agent
Those numbers are not meant to represent the actual s, so do not try to add them. They represent categories, means some are in multiple categories.

I just bought a MacBook Air and a cheap Leadership USB optical mouse, which I can't get to work with the MacBook. It works fine with Windows and Linux, and the Macbook Air USB ports are fine.

If it supports the standard USB mouse functionality (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class" rel="nofollow">HID</a>), it should work.

@JhonnyEverson that means it's either not a standard USB mouse, or something is amiss.  Try USB Prober.

I used to love shift+control+command+4 for pasting screen grabs. But now it doesn't work in Chrome.In Stickies and Text Edit it doesn't work and gives the Apple error sound.The pasting Works fine in Discord, Skype and Firefox.I'm using macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, copy paste image doesn't work in Safari either.This is a real productivity killer.

Since replicating this problem on other systems running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 has proven difficult, it's probably worth starting with some basics to see if we can resolve or narrow down the problem.Your question doesn't actually state what you've already tried (if anything) to resolve this, so perhaps you could start by booting into Safe Mode to see if that makes any difference.Boot into Safe ModeFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:Fully shut down your MacRestart your MacImmediately press the Shift key and keep it down Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).Take a note of what happens (i.e. does shift+control+command+4 work for pasting screen grabs?)Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normalTest againOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.Reset NVRAMOkay, since booting into Safe Mode made no difference, we should now try resetting the NVRAM. Since you haven't specified the model of Mac you're using, refer to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204063" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to reset NVRAM or PRAM on your Mac</a> page.[EDIT] - Known bug in Google ChromeNot really an answer - at least not the one you're looking for - but I decided to check <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bugs.chromium.org</a> to see if this was a known issue. It appears a number of issues relating to copy and paste (and the clipboard generally) in Chrome for macOS have been raised by users. In some cases the issues affect only text, while in others images and text. Some of the reported issues affect Windows, Linux, etc.Below are some examples:<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=814346" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 814346</a><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=818167" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 818167</a><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=800742" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 800742</a><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=830251" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 830251</a><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=830149" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 830149</a><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=827189" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 827189</a>It's hard to know whether any of these are related to your issue or not, especially since not everyone can reproduce it, but it could also be an intermittent bug or combination of bugs.

I wrote an import random code, and unfortunately saved it as the module's name I was trying to call. eg. random.pyI believe, but am not sure, that I created the random.py file twice and thus I deleted the random.pyc, twice, that popped up in the file holding all my python programs, after running import random in the terminal, twice. If I didn't create the random.py twice, somehow another random.pyc (besides the first one) was in the file holding my programs and I deleted it. All the people I asked told me to delete the .pyc, and any file with random, random.pyo as its name. I've checked all my user created files, and none of them fit the description.One of them told me to find and clear the temporary cached version of the random.pyc and random.pyo. My question is where on this MAC air Yosemite can I locate a temporary cached version, and how to safely clear it?

agent
use mdfind to locate all the files with that name (you might need to grep -w for the string or use mdfind with a "kMDItemFSName == whatever.py" clause)Once you know where you've sprayed those files, you could either edit it into the question or decide to do a clean install / migrate user data or remove all the python and then patch that together from a clean install on an external drive.It's had to know what specific things you've done, but hopefully a few of the tools can narrow you down to some options.If I were on deadline and just needed to know what version of python was running - I'd brew install python after setting up <a href="https://brew.sh" rel="nofollow">https://brew.sh</a>You'd then have three installations, but the one that runs from the shell is controllable with $PATH and you can be sure it's up to date with homebrew.

user
I'm like a few days new to python, and programming in general. I used your commands and someone else's to find the original .py, .pyo, .pyc and no duplicates. My problem was resolved by simply going to the path that led to the file, starting python, and calling the module. I will backup my system, immediately, though because I was thinking this entire time I screwed up the Python on my Mac. And next time, I will make my post clearer. Thanks a bunch bmike.

agent
@Red Awesome! Welcome and I'm glad you're learning python and the site. Go ahead and answer your question and then accept it after the waiting period is past. That will help others that are new much more than an "expert's" answer will since different abilities need different levels of detail.

I would like to be able to go into Finder and open files into an existing instance of Sublime Text 2, which has a side menu with all open files.  However, when I hit Open With -> Sublime Text 2.app, it opens a whole new instance of Sublime, which is not what I want.  I can certainly accomplish grouping of my documents in a single instance if I open them within the application but that requires more steps and time, i.e. is not always  as convenient as opening them from Finder.

agent
As shown in <a href="https://superuser.com/a/402122/48132">this answer on SuperUser</a>, you can set this behaviour by changing the open_files_in_new_window setting in Sublime Text to false. (Note that it's recommended that you override the setting in the Settings - User file rather than changing it in Settings - Default.)

user
thanks, it is not clear whether the prefs from the S.U. answer pertain to Finder or Sublime

agent
Those are definitely Sublime Text's preferences, not the Finder's.

unfortunately, those instructions did not work for me.  see my comment on S.U.

As the title says, my iPhone 4S's power button has suddenly stopped "depressing", making it very hard to do push. I understand that Apple offers their own Limited Warranty for a year, but sadly (inevitably?) my phone is a few months beyond that.As I live in the United Kingdom, I know every product has to have a six year warranty, even Apple's, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/legal/statutory-warranty/" rel="nofollow">that's reflected on their website</a>.So, what are my options? Will Apple repair my phone for free? Do I need to go back to the company I bought my phone through? Is this sort of defect even covered by the two year warranty?

agent
@bmike is entirely correct about getting a warranty replacement (or not), but here's the workaround for this issue, as shown to me by a Genius when I had the same problem:Open "Settings"Enable <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5587" rel="nofollow">AssistiveTouch</a> at General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouchOptionally, enable "Triple-click Home" to show/hide the AssistiveTouch dot.Tap the AssistiveTouch dotTap "Device"The "Lock Screen" icon behaves exactly like the lock/power button.You can turn off the phone by holding down the Lock Screen icon, but you'll have to plug it into a power supply to turn it back on.

user
Yes, I've been using this workaround in the meantime, thanks. Problem is that it's super annoying having that dot in the way all the time.

agent
@DjangoReinhardt - Yeah, I agree.  The triple-click is a workaround for the workaround, but then it makes it even harder to lock your phone on the fly...

user
Hehe. And it also looks like it will kill my Home button, too :)

I'm trying to setup a TeamCity Build Agent on a Mac Mini Server running 10.7.3. I have successfully got it running and building but only if I login and launch the process manually. We'd prefer to have the process kick off at startup which appears to be easily done by putting a plist file in the /Library/LaunchDaemon folder. Unfortunately this doesn't work for us as the process fires off as root rather than as our specified user. We really would prefer to keep things constrained to the user's folder and moreover need access to a keychain to handle the iOS code signing mechanics. Unfortunately, using ~/Library/LaunchAgents doesn't work as that seems to require someone visit the terminal and login -- this needs to kick off from boot and stay running when the user is logged out. Is there a way to launch a process as a specified user on boot?

agent
You can easily run as another user with sudo -u like so:#!/bin/shUZER=jsmithsudo -u "$UZER" /path/to/program/you/want/to/runexit 0Just change 'jsmith' to the appropriate short user name, and then save that as a script somewhere, and call from /Library/LaunchDaemonsRemember that all files in /Library/LaunchDaemons must be owned by root to be run.(I think this is what bmike was suggesting)Another optionHowever, I wrote up a HOWTO for making auto-login more secure:<a href="https://www.rhymeswithdiploma.com/2019/01/09/automatic-auto-login.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Terminally Geeky: use automatic login more securely</a>The executive summary is this:Turn on Automatic loginPut this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tjluoma/70c936b36d099e37ed9bf64c1df8debe#file-com-tjluoma-autolock-on-login-plist" rel="nofollow noreferrer">launchd plist</a> in ~/Library/LaunchAgentsRebootWhat it does:As soon as you login, launchd will throw you back to the login screen using:"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession" -suspendNote that is all one long line.Considering that someone with physical access to your computer has a lot of potential exploits, I consider this relatively safe, but of course everyone has to make their own determination. I run this in my small office, but my iMac is in my private office which I can lock when I'm not there.Also note that automatic login doesn't work with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FileVault 2</a>.

user
Does running sudo -u get keychain access for the user specified?

agent
That I do not know. You could try the `security` tool to see if you can access it that way.

user
In the end auto login with your logout was good enough for our purposes.

Two months ago, I accidentally dropped my iPhone 4 into water (for 3 seconds or so). Immediately I turned it off and put it in a bowl of rice. After two days, I took it to a repair shop, in which it was dried and fixed (headphones didn't work after the accident).It was "fine" after that, but since then I've been experiencing some weird issues:GPS isn't working well for navigation (can't seem to locate accurately, tell speed or direction).When the battery is less than 1/4, it suddenly turns off. I have to wait like 10 minutes before turning it on again, and then it turns on normally.The battery drains way faster than it used to.A little blue stain has appeared on the screen.What I want to know is if it is possible that all these issues are related to the accident I had and if/how it can be fixed.

agent
Yes, it is possible, even likely, that one or more of these issues was caused by immersing the iPhone in water. You should seek repair quotes from Apple or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=iPhone%20repair&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">other repair sources</a>, but you'll most likely find that replacing the phone is the most economical solution. Check Craigslist and similar places for people selling their iPhone 4's after upgrading to a 4s. If you're of a DIY mindset, <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/" rel="nofollow">iFixit</a> provides repair information, parts and tools for fixing portable electronics.

user
Do you know if its possible to fix the GPS at least? I don't really understand how that kind of thing can "break".

agent
Water, or more accurately mineral deposits and contaminants contained in the water, create an electrical short circuit allowing power or signal to flow along paths it isn't supposed to. The GPS is part of the 3G radio chip so my best guess–as a person who hasn't seen your phone and is not at all qualified to make a complex diagnosis–is that a failure of the GPS is indicative of major problems and, as I stated in the answer, that unit is most likely **BER** (beyond economical repair—unless you can DIY) or, as we tech-types say colloquially, *toast*I'm sorry that I didn't have a more optimistic answer. Also, I now see you're not here in the US, so I apologize for providing such a US-centric response, but it's really the only point of reference I have. Best of luck getting this sorted.

user
Somehow I knew that would be the answer, so don't worry. Thanks for your time!

I tried to enrol to the iOS Developer program a few months ago, but was unable to do so because my card wasn't acceptable due to some reasons.I now have a new card which can be used with Apple. But I changed my address in the mean time. My account is still stuck at the previous enrolment, with the previous address.  I cannot seem to cancel this enrolment, or start a new one. I cannot edit my information either, which shows up fine at My Apple ID.How do I get out of this situation?

agent
I would call Developer Support directly to get them to look at the specifics for your account:<a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/contact/</a>Choose the Enrollment and Account link and sign in to get your options. It your AppleID doesn't work to sign in, then you need to contact the online store in your country and ask them to connect you with the developer support team. In the US it's 1-800-MY-APPLE. 

user
So there's no way for me to do it without contacting them? I'm already in touch with them on email, but responses are slow.

agent
@duci9y in my experience, this isn't fixable in a self-service fashion. Did you already pay for the developer program and fail at the verification steps or were you unable to complete the initial transaction on the web store?

user
I tried to purchase it, received an "Acknowledgement of Order Request" email, but my card was not charged and I did not get an account. :(

agent
You likely will have to key off that web order number and start with Apple Store support. The last time this happened to me, developer support took 10 minutes to fix everything. I did have to call the next day as they were open 7am to 7pm central time on the developer support side.

user
Okay. Thank you. Sounds like a common issue. I could call them up, only if my country had developer phone support. Thanks anyways! I will wait for the emails.

Yesterday I had to restart my Mac OS X Lion Server and after reboot I observed that I do not have any connection to my LDAPv3 on the localhost as well as no users available in Server application.Next, Server application has showed three outdated certificates. Their names starting with "APNS". I am not sure whether the issue is connected to those certificates specifically, but unfortunately "slapd" refers to issues with main certificates for my internal domain.Following is the log from slapd itself:Oct 27 17:49:57 apple slapd[723]: @(#) $OpenLDAP: slapd 2.4.23 (Jun 24 2012 23:35:56) $    root@grace.apple.com:/private/var/tmp/OpenLDAP/OpenLDAP-186.5~1/servers/slapdOct 27 17:49:57 apple slapd[723]: daemon: SLAP_SOCK_INIT: dtblsize=8192Oct 27 17:49:57 apple slapd[723]: main: TLS init def ctx failed: -1 Oct 27 17:49:57 apple slapd[723]: slapd stopped.System log obviously shows:Oct 27 17:53:19 apple com.apple.launchd[1] (org.openldap.slapd[879]): Exited with code: 1  Oct 27 17:53:19 apple com.apple.launchd[1] (org.openldap.slapd): Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 secondsWhile trying to start slapd from command line (using: /usr/libexec/slapd -d -1), I receive the following message before crash:TLS: attempting to read `/etc/certificates/domain.com.456DACFFC771F8EB2F5A8E0EBB269969B8164097.key.pem'.execv failed TLS: could not use key file `/etc/certificates/domain.com.456DACFFC771F8EB2F5A8E0EBB269969B8164097.key.pem'.LS: error:0D07207B:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_get_object:header too long/SourceCache/OpenSSL098/OpenSSL098-49/src/crypto/asn1/asn1_lib.c:150main: TLS init def ctx failed: -1 slapd destroy: freeing system resources. slapd stopped.If I remove TLS configurations options from "/etc/openldap/slapd_macosxserver.conf" then I am able to start the daemon (using: /usr/libexec/slapd -d -1 -f slapd_macosxserver.conf. All my users a back, I can log-in via Workgroup Manager or Server application.Meanwhile the Server Admin in the Open Directory entry shows that:LDAP Server is: RunningPassword Server is: StoppedKerberos is: RunningI have tried couple of things, but still have no idea how to fix the problem.

agent
I'd recommend <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH8073" rel="nofollow">creating another self-signed cert in Server.app</a> that you can use for securing services (if the others were expired/deleted). By creating the certificate using Server.app, it will automatically be <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH8129" rel="nofollow">available for other services</a> (like Open Directory).After you've created a new self-signed certificate, follow <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH9318" rel="nofollow">steps 6 through 12 in this article</a> (which describe how your SSL certificate can be configured for use with Open Directory). Performing the Open Directory -> Settings -> LDAP -> SSL configuration through Server Admin will write the correct certificate paths into the slapd config file.Once you've corrected the certificate problems, Open Directory (slapd) should start normally (without you having to start it by hand). If Password Server still doesn't show running after that, you might try a reboot (or check to see if it's generating crash logs or other errors in Console.)EditAfter modifying the certificate configuration for use with LDAP, it's probably worth checking to see that the machine has provided updated certificate paths to slapd in the slapd_macosxserver.conf file. That is, the unique string of numbers and characters in the key/cert paths should have changed.To confirm that slapd can access the corresponding private key for the certificate that you're securing LDAP services with, you can check the file at /etc/openldap/slapd_macosxserver.conf...Look for a line mentioning certadmin...That line specifies the command that slapd is using to retrieve the private key from the Keychain. It's possible to perform that command (copy and paste) in Terminal to see if the private key passphrase can be retrieved:/usr/sbin/certadmin --get-private-key-passphrase /etc/certificates/domain.com.456DACFFC771F8EB2F5A8E0EBB269969B8164097.key.pemOnce you've retrieved the passphrase, see if you can view the private key using that passphrase:sudo openssl rsa -in /etc/certificates/domain.com.456DACFFC771F8EB2F5A8E0EBB269969B8164097.key.pem -text -nooutWhen prompted for the pass phrase, copy and paste the value that you obtained in the step above. You should see the private key data output on the screen. This would confirm that:1.) Your private key passphrase can be retrieved from the Keychain2.) The pass phrase in the Keychain can be used to decrypt the keyIf you are unable to get the pass phrase and unlock the key, it's possible that slapd is not able to either. I believe that the software is using a keychain item in the System keychain named "Mac OS X Server certificate management" with a kind of "application password". The "Account" for that keychain item should be set to the same unique string of characters and numbers (456DACFFC771F8EB2F5A8E0EBB269969B8164097 in this example) that you see in the cert/key paths in /etc/certificates. If you do not see one of these corresponding application passwords in the System keychain, it may be your issue.

user
Thank you for answer. Did this as well, the first thing I have tried just because it is obvious and in front of my eyes. It rewrites `slapd_macosxserver.conf` with new TLS... options, then tries to start the service for more than a minute and crashes.

agent
@Dexterite I added some additional suggestions above (retrieving pass phrase for private key)

user
Thank you @Eddie, these steps I have performed as well and had no issues, both command lines worked well. The problem was completely solved by Update to Mavericks, the actual thing I did want to avoid. In any case thank you for reply.

My iPhone is on iOS 4.2.1 and I want to upgrade it to iOS 4.3.3. I know there are newer iOS versions available but they can't be jailbroken untethered. I have the 4.3.3 package from Apple, and I know I can shift-click the "Upgrade" button in iTunes to select this file. When I do, iTunes first extracts the file (no problem) and then tries to verify it, and here's where the trouble starts. iTunes gives me an error 3194 which according to a Google search means that iTunes didn't get a useful response from the validation server. I've checked for these possible causes:The hosts file might have a custom entry which prevents iTunes from getting a response.  I've checked: There are no entries in the hosts file, only #comment lines.A tool like tinyumbrella might have changed the lookup. I installed tinyumbrella and checked: it's set to use normal iTunes settings, no overrides are active.How can I get rid of this error and upgrade to iOS version 4.3.3? I'm on Windows.

agent
That <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3694#error3194" rel="nofollow">specific error</a> is clearly spelled out on the general iOS error charts - <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3694" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3694</a>Saying that it didn't get a useful response is a bit vague. iTunes requires a specific, signed, affirmative response from the apple servers before it will proceed. This is clearly by design. Additionally it checks the version of your iTunes and is asking you to get a newer version. You may not want to upgrade iTunes as some people dislike some of the changes, but it looks like that's the cause here assuming you really removed all the umbrella changes properly. It also might ask for a newer iTunes but the problem isn't actually that.There is a whole set of things to check at the top of the main article: security software, iTunes store tests, using old or modified .ipsw files. It might be good to set up a new user on the windows os and see if you can download 4.3.3 cleanly (or find a pristine copy on the intertubes) and try the restore and debugging of the hosts file from a cleaner start. 

user
Thank you for exact information and links. I have already downloaded the official 4.3.3 version from Apple, so I am confident that this file is clean.

agent
Worst case you can take the device and ipsw to another computer and get it restored. The iTunes diagnostics should flag if you have firewall / spyware / quarantine issues, but sometimes windows OS is just cranky with this error. I know several large IT groups that keep macs around just to load/restore iOS without hassle.

user
The link mentions that the error 3194 is "This device is not eligible for the requested build", but that is not the message I get. Not upgrading iTunes is too late; it's already upgraded. But I'm hoping that with the original 433 ipsw file on disk, I will find a way to get it to work. I'll check the rest of that page.
